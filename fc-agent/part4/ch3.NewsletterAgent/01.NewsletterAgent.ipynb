CEO Sam Altman stresses the importance of reviewing high-risk areas in an AI community buzzing with competition.

This delay was announced as a measure to conduct further safety testing, a move that underscores OpenAI's commitment to responsible AI deployment. Critics may argue that such delays derail innovation timelines, particularly at a time when competitive pressure is mounting from companies like Moonshot AI, which recently released Kimi K2, a model that already outpaces some existing benchmarks set by OpenAI's previous offerings ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/)).\\n\\nThe strategic necessity of such a delay becomes evident when considering the broader landscape of AI deployment. The release of an open-source model carries inherent risks, especially concerning how it might be used or misused once available to the public. Concerns such as cybersecurity vulnerabilities, the potential for generating harmful content, and the amplification of embedded biases necessitate rigorous safety checks prior to any release ([Topmost Ads](https://topmostads.com/openai-open-model-release-delay-analysis/)). OpenAI's decision to pause, rather than rush to the market, reflects an understanding of these challenges and a prioritization of safety, which may ultimately influence industry standards.\\n\\n### Learn to use AI like a Pro\\n\\nGet the latest AI workflows to boost your productivity and business performance, delivered weekly by expert consultants.

The decision lands in the middle of a brutal AI arms race, particularly with Meta, which has been aggressively poaching OpenAI talent and championing open-source models like Llama 3.\\n\\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad![Image 4: Loading Pods](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019)Visit Advertiser website[GO TO PAGE](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019#)\\n\\nThe model, which was slated to drop this week, would be OpenAI’s first major open-weight system, meaning developers would be free to download and use the model’s underlying code and data weights to build their own apps, research projects, or commercial tools. But as Altman pointed out, once these models are released, “they can’t be pulled back.” That’s the nature of open-source, and it’s exactly why this delay is raising eyebrows across the AI community.\\n\\n“While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back,” Altman wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on July 11. “This is new for us and we want to get it right.”\\n\\nWhat Does “Open-Weight” Mean, and Why Does It Matter?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn AI, “weights” are the millions of numerical values that act like the model’s brain wiring, allowing it to make connections and decisions. When a company releases a model as “open-weight,” it’s not just sharing a blueprint; it’s giving away the fully functional brain. Developers are free to download it, modify it, and use it for everything from building chatbots and productivity tools to creating deepfakes and other malicious applications.\\n\\nOpen-sourcing models accelerates innovation, but it also raises the risk of misuse, misinformation, and untraceable custom versions. That’s why the decision to delay, while frustrating to many, signals that OpenAI is trying to tread cautiously, especially as criticism around AI safety and “model leaking” intensifies.\\n\\nRumors Swirl: What’s the Real Reason for the Delay?\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAccording to developer chatter online, the delay may have been triggered by a major technical issue discovered just before launch. The rumored model was expected to be smaller than Kimi K2—the new open-weight model from Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI that reportedly clocks in at nearly a trillion parameters—but still “super powerful,” according to early testers. Kimi K2, which is taking on ChatGPT with impressive coding capabilities at a lower price, was released on July 11, the same day as Altman’s announcement.\\n\\nWhile some online speculators blamed the delay on Kimi’s unexpectedly strong performance and a fear of being outshone, there’s no confirmation of that from OpenAI. What is clear is that the company is feeling the pressure to deliver something that is safe, fast, and competitive.\\n\\nThe Meta Factor\\n---------------\\n\\nOpenAI’s delay comes at a time when Meta is eating its lunch, at least in the open-source department. Mark Zuckerberg’s company has released increasingly powerful open-weight models like Llama 3, all while quietly hiring away top OpenAI researchers. The talent war is real, and it’s affecting timelines and strategy across the board.\\n\\nBy delaying this release, OpenAI may be hoping to avoid a flawed launch that could dent its credibility at a critical moment. But it also risks falling further behind Meta, which has already become the go-to platform for developers looking to build with transparent, modifiable AI tools.\\n\\nWhat’s Next?\\n------------\\n\\nOpenAI hasn’t offered a new timeline for the release. That silence is fueling speculation that the delay could last weeks. If retraining is truly on the table, it could push the launch closer to the fall.\\n\\nFor now, the open-source community is in wait-and-see mode. And the question hanging over it all: Can OpenAI deliver a model that is powerful, safe, and competitive enough to match Meta’s momentum and keep the Chinese rivals at bay? In other words, can they get it right before someone else does?\\n\\n[Mark Zuckerberg](https://gizmodo.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg)[META](https://gizmodo.com/tag/meta)[open source](https://gizmodo.com/tag/open-source)[OpenAI](https://gizmodo.com/tag/openai)\\n\\nDaily Newsletter\\n----------------\\n\\nGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nNews from the future, delivered to your present.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\\n\\nSign me up\\n\\nLeave this field empty if you\\'re human:  \\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n-----------------\\n\\n*   [![Image 5: Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025.](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/elon-musk-white-house-feb-11-2025-GettyImages-2198395928-copy.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Elon Musk’s Nazi Robot Just Landed a Contract With the Department of Defense ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- xAI said it would be \"turning shovels into tokens.\"](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986) By [Matt Novak](https://gizmodo.com/author/mattnovak) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 6: Mark Zuckerberg speaks at an event in San Francisco](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Mark-Zuckerberg-Speaks-at-an-event-in-San-Francisco.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Meta Is Building Massive Gigawatt Data Centers as It Pours Billions Into AI --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,” Mark Zuckerberg said.](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918) By [AJ Dellinger](https://gizmodo.com/author/ajdellinger1) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 7](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/06/5643db31ce5c5a480c18ffb53bed1c80.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/humans-are-starting-to-talk-more-like-chatgpt-study-claims-2000628916)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Humans Are Starting to Talk More Like ChatGPT, Study Claims ----------------------------------------------------------- AI isn’t just getting into your writing.

CEO Sam Altman said Friday the company is delaying the release of its open model, which was [already pushed back a month](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/openais-open-model-is-delayed/) earlier in this summer. OpenAI had planned to release the model next week, however Altman said the company is pushing it back indefinitely for further safety testing.\\n\\n“We need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us,” said Altman in a [post on X](https://x.com/sama/status/1943837550369812814). “While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back. This is new for us and we want to get it right.”\\n\\nOpenAI’s open model release is one of the most highly anticipated AI events of the summer, alongside the ChatGPT-maker’s expected release of GPT-5. Through these launches, OpenAI will attempt to maintain its spot as Silicon Valley’s leading AI lab — an increasingly difficult tasks as xAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic invest billions of dollars in their own efforts.\\n\\nThe delay means developers will have to wait a little longer to try the first open model OpenAI has released in years. TechCrunch previously reported that OpenAI’s open model is expected to have similar reasoning capabilities to the company’s o-series of models, and that [OpenAI planned for it to be best-in-class](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/openai-seeks-to-make-its-upcoming-open-ai-model-best-in-class/) compared to other open models.\\n\\nThe ecosystem of open AI models became a little more competitive this week. Earlier on Friday, Chinese AI startup [Moonshot AI launched Kimi K2,](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/) a one trillion parameter open AI model that outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 AI model on several agentic-coding benchmarks.\\n\\nIn June, when Altman announced the initial delays around OpenAI’s open model, he noted that the company had achieved something “[unexpected and quite amazing,](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/openais-open-model-is-delayed/)” but didn’t elaborate on what that was.\\n\\n“Capability wise, we think the model is phenomenal — but our bar for an open source model is high and we think we need some more time to make sure we’re releasing a model we’re proud of along every axis,” said Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, in a [post on X](https://x.com/_aidan_clark_/status/1943842131136983378) Friday.\\n\\nTechcrunch event\\n\\n### Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass\\n\\n#### Build smarter.

CEO Sam Altman stated that the delay is to allow for further safety tests and a review of high-risk areas, with no confirmed timeline for the release. The open model, which is eagerly anticipated, will be available for developers to freely download and use locally, distinguishing it from OpenAI’s other proprietary models. This move is part of OpenAI’s strategy to maintain its position as a leading AI lab amidst growing competition from companies like xAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. Recently, Moonshot AI, a Chinese startup, launched Kimi K2, a one-trillion-parameter model that reportedly surpasses OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 on several benchmarks. Despite the delays, OpenAI’s VP of Research, Aidan Clark, emphasized the company’s commitment to releasing a model that meets their high standards for open-source AI.\\n\\n#### Tags:\\n\\n[AI

By receiving the neural network\\'s learned parameters, developers can fine-tune or deploy the model locally, but not the entire training stack. That makes the release more flexible than a closed Application Programming Interface, yet still harder to patch once copies are shared. ￼\\n\\nThe hold-up comes as rival xAI grapples with its own safety crisis. Business Insider reported this week that [xAI\\'s Grok chatbot posted antisemitic rants on X](https://www.businessinsider.com/grok-antisemitism-xai-internal-worker-response-slack-2025-7), prompting internal backlash and a temporary posting ban.\\n\\nOpenAI did not mention Grok, and there is no evidence the two events are linked, but the episode highlights the reputational risk of releasing powerful models without robust guardrails.\\n\\nElon Musk\\'s Grok 4 was launched on Wednesday.\\n\\nDevelopers say an open-weight GPT-4-class system from OpenAI could reshape an ecosystem now dominated by Meta\\'s Llama series and a wave of Chinese entrants.\\n\\nFor now, they will have to keep waiting while OpenAI runs what Altman called \"the new, extra-careful process\" to verify its model meets the company\\'s safety bar.\\n\\n### Recommended video\\n\\n*   [OpenAI](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/openai \"OpenAI\")\\n*   [Sam Altman](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/sam-altman \"Sam Altman\")\\n\\nRead next\\n---------\\n\\n![Image 2](https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\\n\\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\\n\\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\n\\n![Image 6](https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\\n\\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\n\\n![Image 8](https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\\n\\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\n\\n[HOME](https://www.businessinsider.com/)[Subscribe](https://www.businessinsider.com/subscription \"Subscribe\")\\n\\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

Together, the two stars would develop future AI consumer devices.The deal was valued at about $6.5 billion. The announcement included a photo shoot of the two men that wouldn\\'t have been out of place in a Vogue spread and a highly produced video in which Altman and Ive sit and chat in a wine bar drinking espresso.A month later, OpenAI removed all mentions of the collaboration from its platforms. Another company, iyO, a Google spinoff, had filed a trademark complaint. The names io and iyO were too similar, the suit says, and by all accounts, the new io collaboration would be developing products similar to ones iyO had planned.US District Judge Trina Thompson ruled that iyO\\'s case is strong enough to move to a hearing this fall. She ordered Altman, Ive, and OpenAI not to use the io brand and take down mentions of the name.OpenAI denied the claims and said it was reviewing its legal options.OpenAI announced on July 9 that, despite the lawsuit, it had completed the deal to acquire io and posted a statement on its website.We\\'re thrilled to share that the io Products, Inc. team has officially merged with OpenAI.

Its longtime strategic partnership with Microsoft [seems to be fraying](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAhNsJvDhrE7hLskqPqVWDFAM7AyQp-pfwiKlzld1kjVC7CBm7H44hT0ZFxR8qc%3D&gaa_ts=686e6ac3&gaa_sig=eQ8hh5GCya1oYwd-mXwWcvZetrwk-YHOQilAp860cvPJAs0zWNApZZs7UeQQHequ7qfqOMzZkWCshHMfcovfNQ%3D%3D). The company’s long drift into for-profit-dom is [coming to a head](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/05/20/openai-profit-pivot). And as the company still at the center of the generative AI boom, OpenAI’s structural pivots and alliance shifts have implications for the rest of the industry.\\n\\n“This is going to be a very, very interesting next 12 to 18 months because of all these dynamics,” Ritu Jyoti, group VP at market intelligence firm IDC, told Tech Brew.\\n\\n**History of change:** Having gathered top research minds in the AI space from day one, OpenAI has always encompassed a series of competing and evolving visions for what the next generation of AI should look like.\\n\\nThat was one of the takeaways Tyler Johnston, executive director of the nonprofit Midas Project, arrived at as he spent the past several months sifting through more than 200 news articles, legal filings, employee testimonials, and other information about OpenAI’s history. The group recently published the result of this work as a research report called the [OpenAI Files](https://www.openaifiles.org/) in partnership with advocacy group Tech Oversight Project.\\n\\n“OpenAI is a company that has existed on this insanely accelerated lifespan,” Johnston told us. “It’s just astonishing how much has happened in the 10 years that it’s existed, and how many different visions of the organization have, at various times, flourished or been squashed based on how convenient they were to the leadership at the time.”\\n\\nBacked by big-name investors and co-founded by Sam Altman and Elon Musk, among others, OpenAI immediately made a splash upon its launch in 2015 as a nonprofit. The lab had already assembled a laundry list of top researchers, with the not-for-profit purpose as part of the recruiting pitch, according to a [Wired feature](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/) at the time.\\n\\n“We just talked about every specific structure and thought this one had the most advantages,” Altman told [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/12/sam-altman-elon-musk-openai) of the nonprofit mission. “I think that the misaligned incentives [of profit-seeking] would be suboptimal to the world as a whole.”\\n\\n**_Some_~~non~~profit:** OpenAI once again grabbed headlines in 2019 when it declared it would not release the full second iteration of its generative pre-trained transformer model (GPT-2) due to “concerns about malicious applications of the technology.” The model was capable of producing “synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality.”\\n\\nA month later, OpenAI converted to a capped profit structure, where returns beyond 100 times an investment would be passed to the nonprofit board. A few months after that, Microsoft invested $1 billion to kick off a “multiyear partnership.”\\n\\n“This was brilliant, by Microsoft, by [CEO] Satya [Nadella],” Vasant Dhar, a data science professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and author of a [forthcoming book](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Machines-Brave-New-World/dp/1394359055) on the history of AI, told Tech Brew. “He just saw this thing coming, you know, from much further away than most people did, and he clinched a really solid deal.”\\n\\n**Frenemy era?** But as OpenAI perhaps continues down its path toward full for-profit status—despite some pushback and potential setbacks—experts we talked with say Microsoft and OpenAI were destined to drift apart eventually. The companies have reportedly clashed over their revenue-sharing agreement and OpenAI’s proposed acquisition of coding platform Windsurf. (The deal ultimately fell through when [Google swooped in](https://www.theverge.com/openai/705999/google-windsurf-ceo-openai) with a shock acquihire of top Windsurf employees.) OpenAI has signed competing cloud agreements, and Microsoft has rolled out competing models.\\n\\nMicrosoft and OpenAI said in a joint statement emailed to Tech Brew that they “have a long-term, productive partnership” and are “optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” a statement also provided to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-dueling-over-artificial-general-intelligence-information-2025-06-25/), and others. In a [January blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/), Microsoft reiterated that its partnership would continue with OpenAI through 2030, while also softening its cloud exclusivity terms.\\n\\nPart of the tension, too, hinges on language around the original agreement, which ends when OpenAI achieves what its board determines to be [AGI](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/resources/glossary/agi), which it defines as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” But AGI does not have a single agreed-upon definition, and that’s [reportedly caused](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/) rifts as well.\\n\\n“That is fundamentally a very, very slippery thing to base your benchmark on, especially as over the past 50 years, we’ve kind of continuously redefined what AGI looks like in practice,” Rowan Curran, principal analyst with Forrester Research, told us.\\n\\nWhile the pressure campaign to keep OpenAI a nonprofit appeared to [notch a win](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/) earlier this year, Johnston argued that the framing of the story was misleading.\\n\\n“In my mind, OpenAI is very conveniently describing control in such a way that they retain a lot of the freedom that they wanted…while still acting as if they had made a concession,” Johnston said.\\n\\nBut an eventual Microsoft-OpenAI split could also be a boon for the overall ecosystem and the companies that are using this technology as it spurs new competition, Jyoti said.\\n\\n“It would diversify the AI providers—it will not be just centered around Microsoft and OpenAI. It will create some new alliances,” Jyoti said. “It will give developers and enterprises more choice, but it can also [add] more complexity.”\\n\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=facebook_share)[](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20company%20is%20drifting%20from%20its%20longtime%20backer%20and%20toward%20for-profit%20status%E2%80%94but%20not%20without%20resistance.&url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=twitter_share&via=MorningBrew)[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=linkedin_share)\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n### Keep up with the innovative tech transforming business\\n\\nTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n![Image 11: logo](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/images/brand-logo-stacked.svg)\\n\\n[About Tech Brew](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/about?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[About Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Advertise with us](https://morningbrewdaily.typeform.com/to/EFVlafWE?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Shop](https://shop.morningbrew.com/?utm_source=mb_main_site&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=main_site_top_nav?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Careers](https://morningbrewinc.com/careers-and-culture?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[FAQ](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/faq?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[](https://www.retailbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.hr-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.marketingbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.cfobrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.revenuebrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.itbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.healthcare-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nIndustry news By Morning brew Inc.\\n\\n© 2025[Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nAll Rights Reserved.\\n\\n[Privacy](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Terms of Service](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/terms-service?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Do Not Sell / Share My Personal Information](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)Cookie Preferences\\n'},\n",

Ultimately, the agency rejected the deal because it felt out of step with how other tech platforms, such as Google and Meta, can bundle in free media to longer-term deals, thereby offsetting the costs of AI tools.\\n\\nOpenAI did not respond to a media request.\\n\\n[![Image 3: The ChatGPT maker eyes new monetization paths with cautious ad plans as it gears up for GPT-5 amid rising legal challenges.](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sam-altman-gpt5-summer-2025.jpg?w=640&h=360&crop=1)](https://www.adweek.com/media/sam-altman-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-ads-on-chatgpt/)\\n\\n[Sam Altman Says GPT-5 Coming This Summer, Open to Ads on ChatGPT—With a Catch](https://www.adweek.com/media/sam-altman-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-ads-on-chatgpt/)\\n\\nHavas has not struck a direct enterprise deal either, due to existing access to GPT models through Azure and its preference to stay within its current Microsoft-based infrastructure, including tools like Teams.\\n\\nTo scale AI use internally, the agency is talking with training companies like Section AI to teach employees model-specific best practices and prompt engineering across multiple AI models.\\n\\n“With big [AI] providers, their number one goal is the sale of licenses,” Dan Hagen, global chief data and technology officer, Havas, told ADWEEK. “Training programs tend to be the second thing they think about.”\\n\\n[![Image 4: Simo, who’s expected to depart Instacart in the coming months, will report directly to Altman.](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/openai-fidji-simo-2025.jpg?w=640&h=360&crop=1)](https://www.adweek.com/media/openai-hires-instacart-ceo-fidji-simo/)\\n\\n[OpenAI Hires Instacart CEO Fidji Simo as Head of Applications](https://www.adweek.com/media/openai-hires-instacart-ceo-fidji-simo/)\\n\\nDallas-based independent agency LERMA, however, is about to sign a direct ChatGPT Enterprise deal with [OpenAI](https://www.adweek.com/category/artificial-intelligence-2/) to support client-facing work and internal tooling. In return, the independent shop gets access to OpenAI’s tools, including Sora and Dall-E, data security, and the ability to build and white-label bots for client use. The financial details of the deal were not disclosed, but it is structured as an annual agreement, paid monthly. LERMA is also evaluating Azure, weighing features and costs before finalizing its decision.\\n\\nLaurie Evans, media technology principal at LERMA, notes that other AI providers, including Microsoft’s Copilot, are offering similar enterprise-level packages.\\n\\n“As an independent agency, we don’t have the resources of big holding companies that can throw a lot of money at innovation,” said Pedro Lerma, founder and CEO, LERMA.“We’re building bots for our workflow on a daily basis—that’s what’s standing out to me about OpenAI,” she added.\\n\\n#### **OpenAI’s changing revenue structure**\\n\\nTo keep revenue growing—and amid its push for profitability under an unorthodox corporate structure—OpenAI [began](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise/) promoting its enterprise offerings in August 2023. These include ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team, and ChatGPT Edu.\\n\\nAs of [June](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/04/openai-chatgpt-enterprise-ai.html), OpenAI said it was signing about nine enterprise contracts per week and had reached 3 million business users across those tiers. OpenAI is [reportedly](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-takes-page-palantir-doubles-consulting-services) charging at least $10 million, offering AI customization and consulting services.\\n\\nOpenAI has doubled its annual recurring revenue, from roughly $5.5 billion last year to [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/openai-hits-10-billion-in-annualized-revenue-fueled-by-chatgpt-growth.html) in June. Yet the San Francisco‑based firm still lost nearly $5 billion in 2024, underscoring the high infrastructure and operational costs of powering generative AI. For now, its revenues come largely from [premium ChatGPT subscriptions](https://www.adweek.com/media/sam-altman-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-ads-on-chatgpt/), like ChatGPT Pro, priced at $200 a month, and API usage ([ads](https://www.adweek.com/media/sam-altman-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-ads-on-chatgpt/) may be coming to ChatGPT).\\n\\nEven so, chief executive Sam Altman recently [posted](https://x.com/sama/status/1876104315296968813) on X that OpenAI is “losing money” on ChatGPT Pro subscriptions, adding that he personally set the price assuming “we would make some money.”\\n\\nNow, OpenAI is turning its attention to ad agencies, striking enterprise deals and deeper partnerships.\\n\\n[![Image 5: The company has officially dropped the GroupM brand.](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wpp-ai-ooh-heathrow-2025.jpeg?w=640&h=360&crop=1)](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/wpp-touts-ai-investments-in-new-b2b-campaign/)\\n\\n[WPP Touts AI Investments in New B2B Campaign](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/wpp-touts-ai-investments-in-new-b2b-campaign/)\\n\\n#### **Agencies’ relationship with Microsoft**\\n\\nThrough Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI, which integrates OpenAI’s IP, including models and infrastructure, into products like Copilot (Microsoft’s AI assistant) and Azure (its cloud computing platform), certain agencies can already access OpenAI’s tools without signing up and paying for a direct enterprise deal. That access lets them use OpenAI for image and video generation or call the API to build agents, according to sources, all within Microsoft’s ecosystem.\\n\\nWithout a direct relationship with OpenAI, agencies do miss out on enterprise-level perks, like 24/7 support, live training, custom bot deployments, or immediate access to OpenAI’s latest tools, which [reportedly](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/chatgpt-vs-copilot-inside-the-openai-and-microsoft-rivalry?srnd=undefined) takes weeks before showing up in Microsoft software.\\n\\nGartner estimates ChatGPT Enterprise costs between $40 and $60 per user per month, higher than Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is typically priced at $30 and often bundled with other Microsoft products. These estimates are based on Gartner’s Digital Workplace Maturity Assessment Tool, which surveyed IT leaders on their digital transformation priorities. OpenAI did not respond to comments on competitive pricing.\\n\\n“The pricing structures, security assurances, and integrations provided by Microsoft, such as Azure AI Studio and Microsoft 365 Copilot, align with enterprise operational requirements and risk management protocols,” Greene said. “[These are] compelling reasons for ad agencies to work with Microsoft instead of making a direct enterprise deal with OpenAI.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, OpenAI [announced](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487671-flexible-pricing-for-chatgpt-enterprise-plans) last month that it would shift its ChatGPT Enterprise plan from a pricing-based model to a credit-based system where companies can purchase usage credits based on demand rather than paying fixed per-seat pricing.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for its part, is seeing clear returns from its integration with OpenAI. In a recent [investor](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4463381-openais-contribution-to-azure-ai-revenue-appears-bullish-to-morgan-stanley) note, Morgan Stanley raised its Azure revenue forecast, citing OpenAI as a key growth driver. Analysts now expect Azure to grow at a 33% compound annual rate through 2028, up from an earlier 27% estimate.\\n\\n“Contribution from OpenAI is significant and understated in our original framework,” the note read, pointing to Microsoft’s 20% revenue share from OpenAI, along with additional income from fine-tuning and post-training services.\\n\\nStill, the partnership with OpenAI ends in 2030. Microsoft did not directly andwer questions about what will happen after that date, instead pointing to [its blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/) on how the relationship has evolved.\\n\\n[![Image 6: Headshot of Trishla Ostwal](https://static-prod.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/trishla-ostwal-1x1-2022.jpg)](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/trishla-ostwal/)\\n\\n#### [Trishla Ostwal](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/trishla-ostwal/)\\n\\nTrishla is an Adweek staff reporter covering tech policy.\\n\\n[@trishlaostwal](https://twitter.com/trishlaostwal)|[trishla.ostwal@adweek.com](mailto:trishla.ostwal@adweek.com)\\n\\n Recommended videos \\n\\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad![Image 7: Loading Pods](https://www.adweek.com/media/microsofts-openai-deal-undercutting-ad-agency-partnerships/)Visit Advertiser website[GO TO PAGE](https://www.adweek.com/media/microsofts-openai-deal-undercutting-ad-agency-partnerships/#)\\n\\nThe Latest\\n----------\\n\\n*   [![Image 8](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/digitas-otterbox-aor-2025.png) ### Behind OtterBox’s Gen Z Brand Refresh From New Agency Digitas](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/behind-otterboxs-gen-z-brand-refresh-from-new-agency-digitas/) \\n*   [![Image 9](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/adtech-ceo-employee-compensation-2025.jpg) ### Here’s How Much Adtech CEOs Made in 2024](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/how-much-adtech-ceo-salary-2024/) \\n*   [![Image 10](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/untangld_cover-e1751902439468.jpeg) ### Amy Gilmore Named Strategy Partner at Untangld](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/amy-gilmore-named-strategy-partner-at-untangld/) \\n\\n[ADWEEK Branded](https://www.adweek.com/lineup/adweek-branded/)[Read More](https://www.adweek.com/lineup/adweek-branded/)\\n\\n[![Image 11: post-image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/adweek-placeholder.svg)](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/the-performance-powerhouse-youre-sleeping-on/)\\n\\n[The Performance Powerhouse You’re Sleeping On](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/the-performance-powerhouse-youre-sleeping-on/)\\n\\n By [Ginny Marvin, Ads Product Liaison, Google Ads](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/ginny-marvin-ads-product-liaison-google-ads/)\\n\\n[![Image 12: post-image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/adweek-placeholder.svg)](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/what-if-we-visualized-and-marketed-a-better-future/)\\n\\n[What If We Visualized—and Marketed—a Better Future?](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/what-if-we-visualized-and-marketed-a-better-future/)\\n\\n By [Tristen Norman, Director and Head of Creative for the Americas, Getty Images](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/tristen-norman-director-and-head-of-creative-for-the-americas-getty-images/)\\n\\n[![Image 13: post-image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/adweek-placeholder.svg)](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/why-linear-tv-and-streaming-work-better-together/)\\n\\n[Why Linear TV and Streaming Work Better Together](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/why-linear-tv-and-streaming-work-better-together/)\\n\\n By [Andy Schonfeld, Chief Revenue Officer, Tatari](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/andy-schonfeld-chief-revenue-officer-tatari/)\\n\\n[![Image 14: post-image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/adweek-placeholder.svg)](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/why-fast-is-the-next-frontier-for-advertisers/)\\n\\n[Why FAST Is the Next Frontier for Advertisers](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/why-fast-is-the-next-frontier-for-advertisers/)\\n\\n By [Amy Leifer, Chief Advertising Sales Officer, DIRECTV Advertising](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/amy-leifer-chief-advertising-sales-officer-directv-advertising/)\\n\\n### Newsletters\\n\\n![Image 15: Newsletter Subscribe Image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Daily.jpg)\\n\\n- [x] ADWEEK Daily \\n\\n Start your morning right with a round-up of first-look news and sharp analysis you won't find elsewhere. \\n\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our[Terms of Use](https://www.adweek.com/terms-use/)and[Privacy Policy](https://www.adweek.com/privacy-policy/).

It’s a number so large it’s almost meaningless, more than the entire economy of Germany or the United Kingdom. While Wall Street celebrates, the question for everyone else is simple: So what?\\n\\nThe answer, according to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, is that this is not just about stock prices. It’s about a fundamental rewiring of our world.\\n\\nSo why is this one company so important? In the simplest terms, Nvidia makes the “brains” for artificial intelligence. Their advanced chips, known as GPUs, are the engines that power everything from ChatGPT to the complex AI models being built by Google and Microsoft. In the global gold rush for AI, Nvidia is selling all the picks and shovels, and it has made them the most powerful company on the planet.\\n\\nIn a wide ranging interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Huang, the company’s leather jacket clad founder, explained what this new era of AI, powered by his chips, will mean for ordinary people.\\n\\nAI Will Change Every Job\\n------------------------\\n\\nHuang didn’t sugarcoat it. “Everybody’s jobs will be affected, “Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost,” he said. Some will disappear. Others will be reborn. The hope, he said, is that AI will boost productivity so dramatically that society becomes richer overall, even if the disruption is painful along the way.\\n\\nHe admitted the stakes are high. A recent World Economic Forum [survey](https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_Report_2025.pdf) found that 41% of employers plan to reduce their workforce by 2030 because of AI. And inside Nvidia itself, Huang said, using AI isn’t just encouraged. It’s mandatory. One of Huang’s boldest claims is that AI’s future depends on America learning to build things again. He offered surprising support for the Trump administration’s push to re-industrialize the country, calling it not just a smart political move but an economic necessity.\\n\\n“That passion, the skill, the craft of making things; the ability to make things is valuable for economic growth. It’s valuable for a stable society with people who can create a wonderful life and a wonderful career without having to get a PhD in physics,” he said. Huang believes that onshoring manufacturing will strengthen national security, reduce reliance on foreign chipmakers like Taiwan’s TSMC, and open high-paying jobs to workers without advanced degrees.\\n\\nThis stance aligns with Trump’s tariffs and “Made in America” push, a rare moment of agreement between Big Tech and MAGA world.\\n\\nAI Will Help Cure Disease\\n-------------------------\\n\\nIn perhaps his most optimistic prediction, Huang described AI’s power to revolutionize medicine. He believes AI tools will speed up drug discovery, crack the code of human biology, and even help researchers cure all disease.\\n\\n“Over time, we’re going to have virtual assistant researchers and scientists to help us essentially cure all disease,” Huang said.\\n\\nAI models are already being trained on the “language” of proteins, chemicals, and genetics. Huang says we’ll soon see powerful AI partners in labs across the world.\\n\\nThe Robots Are Already Here\\n---------------------------\\n\\nYou may not see them yet, but Huang says the technology for physical, intelligent robots already works, and that we’ll see them in the next three to five years. He calls them “VLA models,” short for vision-language-action. These robots will be able to see, understand instructions, and take action in the real world.\\n\\nAI Will Cause Harm, but It’s Worth It\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nHuang didn’t dodge the darker side of the AI boom. When asked about controversies like Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok spreading antisemitic content, he admitted “some harm will be done.”\\n\\nBut he urged people to be patient as safety tools improve. He said most AI models already use other AIs to fact-check outputs, and the technology is getting better every day.\\n\\nHis bottom line: AI will be overwhelmingly positive, even if it gets messy along the way.\\n\\nOur Take\\n--------\\n\\nJensen Huang talks about AI curing diseases and reshaping work. But here’s what’s left unsaid: every transformation he describes flows through Nvidia. They make the chips. They set the pace. And now, at $4 trillion, they have the leverage to steer the AI era in their favor. We’ve seen this playbook before. Tech giants make utopian promises, capture the infrastructure, and then decide who gets access, and at what cost. From Amazon warehouses to Facebook news feeds, the pattern is always the same: consolidation, disruption, control.\\n\\nThe AI hype machine keeps selling inevitability. But behind the scenes, this is a story about raw power. Nvidia is becoming a gatekeeper for what’s possible in science, labor, and security. And most of us didn’t get a vote.\\n\\nHuang says harm will happen. But history tells us that when companies promise to fix the world with tech, the harm tends to land on the same people every time.\\n\\n[diseases](https://gizmodo.com/tag/diseases)[Drugs](https://gizmodo.com/tag/drugs)[Nvidia](https://gizmodo.com/tag/nvidia)[Robotics](https://gizmodo.com/tag/robotics)[Society](https://gizmodo.com/tag/society)\\n\\nDaily Newsletter\\n----------------\\n\\nGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nNews from the future, delivered to your present.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\\n\\nSign me up\\n\\nLeave this field empty if you\\'re human:  \\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n-----------------\\n\\n*   [![Image 4: Nvidia Unveils Robot Training Tech, New Gaming Chips, And Toyota Deal](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang-RTX-50-Series-GPU-1.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/it-started-with-games-now-its-the-worlds-first-ever-4-trillion-company-2000626863)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Nvidia Makes History -------------------- The chipmaker hits a historic milestone as Wall Street’s biggest bet on AI pays off.](https://gizmodo.com/it-started-with-games-now-its-the-worlds-first-ever-4-trillion-company-2000626863) By [Luc Olinga](https://gizmodo.com/author/lucolinga1) Published July 9, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 5: The Google DeepMind logo on the walls of an office](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2177657481.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/an-ai-that-promises-to-solve-all-diseases-is-about-to-test-its-first-human-drugs-2000626366)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence An AI That Promises to ‘Solve All Diseases’ Is About to Test Its First Human Drugs ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A secretive, Google-backed lab is using artificial intelligence to invent new medicines for humanity\\'s worst illnesses.

A national teachers union and several tech industry giants are joining forces to equip hundreds of thousands of educators with the skills to use artificial intelligence in their classrooms.\\n\\nThe National Academy for AI Instruction, created by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) in partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthology, will provide free curriculum and certification opportunities to AFT members, according to an [announcement](https://www.aft.org/press-release/aft-launch-national-academy-ai-instruction-microsoft-openai-anthropic-and-united) last week.\\n\\nThe new program aims to scale up [past](https://aflcio.org/press/releases/afl-cio-and-microsoft-announce-new-tech-labor-partnership-ai-and-future-workforce) summer symposiums on AI held through the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and Microsoft.\\n\\n“We jointly hosted symposiums over the last two summers, but never reached critical mass to ensure America’s educators are coaches in the game, not spectators on the sidelines,” AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a public statement.\\n\\nThe academy will offer AI instruction starting this fall based at a facility in Manhattan, combining in-person workshops, online courses, credential pathways and continuing education credits, all designed by educators and AI experts. The news release said over the next five years, AFT plans to train 400,000 K-12 educators, representing roughly 10 percent of the U.S. teaching workforce.\\n\\n“The academy is a place where educators and school staff will learn about AI — not just how it works, but how to use it wisely, safely and ethically,” Weingarten said.\\n\\nIt will also serve as an innovation lab, refining its tools and strategies based on classroom experiences. The news release said the ultimate aim of the program is to create a national model for AI integration.\\n\\nAccording to its [website](https://openai.com/global-affairs/aft/), OpenAI is contributing $8 million directly to the effort, as well as providing $2 million in technical support and computing access. This includes priority access to OpenAI educational tools, API credits that educators can use to create customized classroom tools, and assistance integrating AI into school learning systems.\\n\\n“To best serve students, we must ensure teachers have a strong voice in the development and use of AI,” Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, said in a public statement. “This partnership will not only help teachers learn how to better use AI, it will give them the opportunity to tell tech companies how we can create AI that better serves kids.”\\n\\nThe academy is expected to expand through additional regional hubs by 2030. \\n\\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=314190606794339&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.govtech.com%2Feducation%2Fk-12%2Ftech-giants-aft-launch-national-ai-training-academy-for-educators)\\n*   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.govtech.com%2Feducation%2Fk-12%2Ftech-giants-aft-launch-national-ai-training-academy-for-educators&mini=true&title=Tech%20Giants%2C%20AFT%20Launch%20National%20AI%20Training%20Academy%20for%20Educators&summary=A%20new%20%2423%20million%20initiative%20by%20the%20American%20Federation%20of%20Teachers%2C%20OpenAI%2C%20Microsoft%20and%20Anthology%20aims%20to%20train%20400%2C000%20educators%20in%20ethical%2C%20effective%20use%20of%20AI%20in%20the%20classroom%20by%202030.&source=GovTech)\\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.govtech.com%2Feducation%2Fk-12%2Ftech-giants-aft-launch-national-ai-training-academy-for-educators&text=Tech%20Giants%2C%20AFT%20Launch%20National%20AI%20Training%20Academy%20for%20Educators)\\n*   [Print](javascript:window.print())\\n*   [Email](mailto:?body=Tech%20Giants%2C%20AFT%20Launch%20National%20AI%20Training%20Academy%20for%20Educators%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.govtech.com%2Feducation%2Fk-12%2Ftech-giants-aft-launch-national-ai-training-academy-for-educators%0A%0AA%20new%20%2423%20million%20initiative%20by%20the%20American%20Federation%20of%20Teachers%2C%20OpenAI%2C%20Microsoft%20and%20Anthology%20aims%20to%20train%20400%2C000%20educators%20in%20ethical%2C%20effective%20use%20of%20AI%20in%20the%20classroom%20by%202030.)\\n\\nTags:\\n-----\\n\\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.govtech.com/tag/artificial-intelligence)[Technical Education](https://www.govtech.com/tag/technical-education)[K-12](https://www.govtech.com/tag/k-12)[Education](https://www.govtech.com/tag/education)\\n\\n[News Staff](https://www.govtech.com/authors/news-staff.html)\\n\\n[See More Stories by News Staff](https://www.govtech.com/authors/news-staff.html)\\n\\nSign Up Today\\n\\nDon\\'t miss a headline and stay on top of the latest EdTech trends.\\n\\n*   -

Ultimately, the agency rejected the deal because it felt out of step with how other tech platforms, such as Google and Meta, can bundle in free media to longer-term deals, thereby offsetting the costs of AI tools.\\n\\nOpenAI did not respond to a media request.\\n\\n[![Image 3: The ChatGPT maker eyes new monetization paths with cautious ad plans as it gears up for GPT-5 amid rising legal challenges.](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sam-altman-gpt5-summer-2025.jpg?w=640&h=360&crop=1)](https://www.adweek.com/media/sam-altman-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-ads-on-chatgpt/)\\n\\n[Sam Altman Says GPT-5 Coming This Summer, Open to Ads on ChatGPT—With a Catch](https://www.adweek.com/media/sam-altman-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-ads-on-chatgpt/)\\n\\nHavas has not struck a direct enterprise deal either, due to existing access to GPT models through Azure and its preference to stay within its current Microsoft-based infrastructure, including tools like Teams.\\n\\nTo scale AI use internally, the agency is talking with training companies like Section AI to teach employees model-specific best practices and prompt engineering across multiple AI models.\\n\\n“With big [AI] providers, their number one goal is the sale of licenses,” Dan Hagen, global chief data and technology officer, Havas, told ADWEEK. “Training programs tend to be the second thing they think about.”\\n\\n[![Image 4: Simo, who’s expected to depart Instacart in the coming months, will report directly to Altman.](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/openai-fidji-simo-2025.jpg?w=640&h=360&crop=1)](https://www.adweek.com/media/openai-hires-instacart-ceo-fidji-simo/)\\n\\n[OpenAI Hires Instacart CEO Fidji Simo as Head of Applications](https://www.adweek.com/media/openai-hires-instacart-ceo-fidji-simo/)\\n\\nDallas-based independent agency LERMA, however, is about to sign a direct ChatGPT Enterprise deal with [OpenAI](https://www.adweek.com/category/artificial-intelligence-2/) to support client-facing work and internal tooling. In return, the independent shop gets access to OpenAI’s tools, including Sora and Dall-E, data security, and the ability to build and white-label bots for client use. The financial details of the deal were not disclosed, but it is structured as an annual agreement, paid monthly. LERMA is also evaluating Azure, weighing features and costs before finalizing its decision.\\n\\nLaurie Evans, media technology principal at LERMA, notes that other AI providers, including Microsoft’s Copilot, are offering similar enterprise-level packages.\\n\\n“As an independent agency, we don’t have the resources of big holding companies that can throw a lot of money at innovation,” said Pedro Lerma, founder and CEO, LERMA.“We’re building bots for our workflow on a daily basis—that’s what’s standing out to me about OpenAI,” she added.\\n\\n#### **OpenAI’s changing revenue structure**\\n\\nTo keep revenue growing—and amid its push for profitability under an unorthodox corporate structure—OpenAI [began](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise/) promoting its enterprise offerings in August 2023. These include ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team, and ChatGPT Edu.\\n\\nAs of [June](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/04/openai-chatgpt-enterprise-ai.html), OpenAI said it was signing about nine enterprise contracts per week and had reached 3 million business users across those tiers. OpenAI is [reportedly](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-takes-page-palantir-doubles-consulting-services) charging at least $10 million, offering AI customization and consulting services.\\n\\nOpenAI has doubled its annual recurring revenue, from roughly $5.5 billion last year to [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/openai-hits-10-billion-in-annualized-revenue-fueled-by-chatgpt-growth.html) in June. Yet the San Francisco‑based firm still lost nearly $5 billion in 2024, underscoring the high infrastructure and operational costs of powering generative AI. For now, its revenues come largely from [premium ChatGPT subscriptions](https://www.adweek.com/media/sam-altman-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-ads-on-chatgpt/), like ChatGPT Pro, priced at $200 a month, and API usage ([ads](https://www.adweek.com/media/sam-altman-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-ads-on-chatgpt/) may be coming to ChatGPT).\\n\\nEven so, chief executive Sam Altman recently [posted](https://x.com/sama/status/1876104315296968813) on X that OpenAI is “losing money” on ChatGPT Pro subscriptions, adding that he personally set the price assuming “we would make some money.”\\n\\nNow, OpenAI is turning its attention to ad agencies, striking enterprise deals and deeper partnerships.\\n\\n[![Image 5: The company has officially dropped the GroupM brand.](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wpp-ai-ooh-heathrow-2025.jpeg?w=640&h=360&crop=1)](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/wpp-touts-ai-investments-in-new-b2b-campaign/)\\n\\n[WPP Touts AI Investments in New B2B Campaign](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/wpp-touts-ai-investments-in-new-b2b-campaign/)\\n\\n#### **Agencies’ relationship with Microsoft**\\n\\nThrough Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI, which integrates OpenAI’s IP, including models and infrastructure, into products like Copilot (Microsoft’s AI assistant) and Azure (its cloud computing platform), certain agencies can already access OpenAI’s tools without signing up and paying for a direct enterprise deal. That access lets them use OpenAI for image and video generation or call the API to build agents, according to sources, all within Microsoft’s ecosystem.\\n\\nWithout a direct relationship with OpenAI, agencies do miss out on enterprise-level perks, like 24/7 support, live training, custom bot deployments, or immediate access to OpenAI’s latest tools, which [reportedly](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/chatgpt-vs-copilot-inside-the-openai-and-microsoft-rivalry?srnd=undefined) takes weeks before showing up in Microsoft software.\\n\\nGartner estimates ChatGPT Enterprise costs between $40 and $60 per user per month, higher than Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is typically priced at $30 and often bundled with other Microsoft products. These estimates are based on Gartner’s Digital Workplace Maturity Assessment Tool, which surveyed IT leaders on their digital transformation priorities. OpenAI did not respond to comments on competitive pricing.\\n\\n“The pricing structures, security assurances, and integrations provided by Microsoft, such as Azure AI Studio and Microsoft 365 Copilot, align with enterprise operational requirements and risk management protocols,” Greene said. “[These are] compelling reasons for ad agencies to work with Microsoft instead of making a direct enterprise deal with OpenAI.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, OpenAI [announced](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487671-flexible-pricing-for-chatgpt-enterprise-plans) last month that it would shift its ChatGPT Enterprise plan from a pricing-based model to a credit-based system where companies can purchase usage credits based on demand rather than paying fixed per-seat pricing.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for its part, is seeing clear returns from its integration with OpenAI. In a recent [investor](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4463381-openais-contribution-to-azure-ai-revenue-appears-bullish-to-morgan-stanley) note, Morgan Stanley raised its Azure revenue forecast, citing OpenAI as a key growth driver. Analysts now expect Azure to grow at a 33% compound annual rate through 2028, up from an earlier 27% estimate.\\n\\n“Contribution from OpenAI is significant and understated in our original framework,” the note read, pointing to Microsoft’s 20% revenue share from OpenAI, along with additional income from fine-tuning and post-training services.\\n\\nStill, the partnership with OpenAI ends in 2030. Microsoft did not directly andwer questions about what will happen after that date, instead pointing to [its blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/) on how the relationship has evolved.\\n\\n[![Image 6: Headshot of Trishla Ostwal](https://static-prod.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/trishla-ostwal-1x1-2022.jpg)](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/trishla-ostwal/)\\n\\n#### [Trishla Ostwal](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/trishla-ostwal/)\\n\\nTrishla is an Adweek staff reporter covering tech policy.\\n\\n[@trishlaostwal](https://twitter.com/trishlaostwal)|[trishla.ostwal@adweek.com](mailto:trishla.ostwal@adweek.com)\\n\\n Recommended videos \\n\\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad![Image 7: Loading Pods](https://www.adweek.com/media/microsofts-openai-deal-undercutting-ad-agency-partnerships/)Visit Advertiser website[GO TO PAGE](https://www.adweek.com/media/microsofts-openai-deal-undercutting-ad-agency-partnerships/#)\\n\\nThe Latest\\n----------\\n\\n*   [![Image 8](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/digitas-otterbox-aor-2025.png) ### Behind OtterBox’s Gen Z Brand Refresh From New Agency Digitas](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/behind-otterboxs-gen-z-brand-refresh-from-new-agency-digitas/) \\n*   [![Image 9](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/adtech-ceo-employee-compensation-2025.jpg) ### Here’s How Much Adtech CEOs Made in 2024](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/how-much-adtech-ceo-salary-2024/) \\n*   [![Image 10](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/untangld_cover-e1751902439468.jpeg) ### Amy Gilmore Named Strategy Partner at Untangld](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/amy-gilmore-named-strategy-partner-at-untangld/) \\n\\n[ADWEEK Branded](https://www.adweek.com/lineup/adweek-branded/)[Read More](https://www.adweek.com/lineup/adweek-branded/)\\n\\n[![Image 11: post-image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/adweek-placeholder.svg)](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/the-performance-powerhouse-youre-sleeping-on/)\\n\\n[The Performance Powerhouse You’re Sleeping On](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/the-performance-powerhouse-youre-sleeping-on/)\\n\\n By [Ginny Marvin, Ads Product Liaison, Google Ads](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/ginny-marvin-ads-product-liaison-google-ads/)\\n\\n[![Image 12: post-image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/adweek-placeholder.svg)](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/what-if-we-visualized-and-marketed-a-better-future/)\\n\\n[What If We Visualized—and Marketed—a Better Future?](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/what-if-we-visualized-and-marketed-a-better-future/)\\n\\n By [Tristen Norman, Director and Head of Creative for the Americas, Getty Images](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/tristen-norman-director-and-head-of-creative-for-the-americas-getty-images/)\\n\\n[![Image 13: post-image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/adweek-placeholder.svg)](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/why-linear-tv-and-streaming-work-better-together/)\\n\\n[Why Linear TV and Streaming Work Better Together](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/why-linear-tv-and-streaming-work-better-together/)\\n\\n By [Andy Schonfeld, Chief Revenue Officer, Tatari](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/andy-schonfeld-chief-revenue-officer-tatari/)\\n\\n[![Image 14: post-image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/adweek-next/src/images/adweek-placeholder.svg)](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/why-fast-is-the-next-frontier-for-advertisers/)\\n\\n[Why FAST Is the Next Frontier for Advertisers](https://www.adweek.com/sponsored/why-fast-is-the-next-frontier-for-advertisers/)\\n\\n By [Amy Leifer, Chief Advertising Sales Officer, DIRECTV Advertising](https://www.adweek.com/contributor/amy-leifer-chief-advertising-sales-officer-directv-advertising/)\\n\\n### Newsletters\\n\\n![Image 15: Newsletter Subscribe Image](https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Daily.jpg)\\n\\n- [x] ADWEEK Daily \\n\\n Start your morning right with a round-up of first-look news and sharp analysis you won't find elsewhere. \\n\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our[Terms of Use](https://www.adweek.com/terms-use/)and[Privacy Policy](https://www.adweek.com/privacy-policy/).

Instead, Google plans to hire Windsurf\\'s CEO and some staff.\\n\\nGoogle has announced a significant deal with AI-coding startup Windsurf, securing a $2.4 billion license to the company\\'s technology while recruiting its CEO and select R&D team into DeepMind. The deal, announced on July 11, 2025, marks a strategic move by Google to bolster its position in the rapidly evolving AI coding landscape [1].\\n\\nWindsurf, which reached a $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April 2025, had attracted major suitors due to its rapid growth. The startup\\'s technology has been in high demand, with companies like OpenAI and Google vying for its capabilities. However, OpenAI\\'s $3 billion bid to acquire Windsurf reportedly fell apart due to contract renegotiations with Microsoft, which already holds access to OpenAI\\'s intellectual property [2].\\n\\nFollowing the leadership exits, Jeff Wang, Windsurf\\'s head of business, has stepped in as interim CEO. Most of the 250-person team will continue focusing on enterprise AI coding tools, but the company\\'s long-term trajectory remains uncertain. Similar reverse-acquihire startups like Scale AI and Inflection have struggled to maintain momentum post-deal [1].\\n\\nThe deal is expected to significantly boost Google\\'s ability to build AI coding tools, as the company aims to stay competitive in the AI race. As AI model providers increasingly focus on offering AI coding applications to entice developers, Google\\'s acquisition of Windsurf\\'s talent and technology positions it well to capitalize on this trend [1].\\n\\nGoogle\\'s $2.4 billion \\'acquihire\\' gambit comes on the heels of the collapse of OpenAI\\'s acquisition of Windsurf, which was reportedly blocked by a Microsoft IP rights objection. The original deal stalled because Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, objected to the terms. Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI entitles it to the startup’s intellectual property, but OpenAI was unwilling to grant it access to Windsurf’s tech [2].\\n\\nThis incident lays bare the inherent tensions in the OpenAI-Microsoft relationship. While Microsoft’s investment has been crucial for OpenAI’s access to capital and computing power, the strings attached can clearly limit its strategic freedom. For OpenAI, the inability to acquire a key asset like Windsurf without ceding its IP to its main partner—and in this case, competitor—is a significant strategic blow [2].\\n\\nThe AI talent war continues to escalate, but this move signals a new level of strategic complexity. It’s no longer just about poaching individual researchers with massive pay packages, as seen in the recent Meta-OpenAI skirmishes. Now, the battles are being fought over entire teams, intellectual property rights, and the very structure of corporate partnerships [2].\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n[1] https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\\n\\n[2] https://winbuzzer.com/2025/07/12/googles-2-4b-windsurf-deal-followed-openai-collapse-over-microsoft-ip-veto-xcxwbn/\\n\\n![Image 8: OpenAI Ends Acquisition Talks with Windsurf Over Microsoft IP Concerns](https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1afa886381ed1002.png)\\n\\nAsk Aime: *Why did OpenAI end its acquisition talks with Windsurf?*\\n\\n[View Source](https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/openai-ends-acquisition-talks-with-windsurf-information-reports-thefly?mod=mw_quote_news)\\n\\n![Image 9: whatsapp](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/whats.a186d888.png)\\n\\nWhatsapp\\n\\n![Image 10: link](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/link.5ef2f16a.png)\\n\\nLink\\n\\n![Image 11: x](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/twitter.2dcb9532.png)\\n\\nX\\n\\n![Image 12: facebook](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/facebook.2c4171b5.png)\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n![Image 13: linkedin](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/linkedin.decd6a36.png)\\n\\nLinkedin\\n\\n![Image 14: Aime Insights](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/aimeIcon.f9bef261.png)\\nAime Insights\\n-------------\\n\\nWhat impact does Elon Musk\\'s denial of xAI fundraising have on Tesla\\'s stock price?\\n\\nHow might the XRP ETF launches affect institutional investors?\\n\\nIn light of these events, what are the investment strategies for investors looking to capitalize on emerging AI trends?\\n\\nWhat are the implications of Ripple\\'s banking license for XRP\\'s future?\\n\\nTop News\\n\\n[Elon Musk Denies xAI Fundraising Amid $200 Billion Valuation Speculation Coin World 10h ago ![Image 15: Elon Musk Denies xAI Fundraising Amid $200 Billion Valuation Speculation](https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1afa1c6dfd138001.png)](https://www.ainvest.com/news/elon-musk-denies-xai-fundraising-200-billion-valuation-speculation-2507/ \"Elon Musk Denies xAI Fundraising Amid $200 Billion Valuation Speculation\")[Fed Chair Powell Faces Pressure Amid Resignation Speculation Coin World 16h ago ![Image 16: Fed Chair Powell Faces Pressure Amid Resignation Speculation](https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1af9c6b5ab020001.png)](https://www.ainvest.com/news/fed-chair-powell-faces-pressure-resignation-speculation-2507/ \"Fed Chair Powell Faces Pressure Amid Resignation Speculation\")[Coinbase partners with Perplexity AI to deliver real-time market data -

AI](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/472303-45) is the latest artificial intelligence startup to part ways with its founders in exchange for a huge sum of money as they join a big tech company.\\n\\nThese deals not only underscore just how intense the battle for AI experts has grown, but also raise questions about their sustainability. While [Windsurf’s remaining business](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/cognition-purchase-windsurf-after-google-2-4b-acqui-hire) found a home at Cognition AI, most of these startups have continued on independently in some form.\\n\\nTypically, they include: a licensing deal for the startup’s technology, the hiring of the startup’s key personnel for eye-popping compensation packages, some form of financial compensation for the startup’s investors, and a plan and resources so it can carry on alone with new management.\\n\\nSo far, the narrative that big tech companies seem to have happily failed to correct is that years of increased M&A regulatory scrutiny and hostility have led to these workaround deals. In recent years especially, regulators have taken exception to large proposed tech deals. And moreover, the current US approval process is just too slow for the speed at which AI tech evolution is moving, Category Ventures managing partner Villi Iltchev explained in [a recent blog post](https://medium.com/@villispeaks/the-blitzhire-acquisition-e39361ed00bb).\\n\\nBut it’s also an admission that, amid the current global AI race, expertise and talent are the real assets. The acquirers want the highly skilled fisherman, not his bucket of fish.\\n\\nWe rounded up these deals in a handy list:\\n\\n_Featured image by Josie Doan/PitchBook News_\\n\\nLearn more about our [editorial standards](https://pitchbook.com/news/pitchbook-news-editorial-standards-code-conduct).\\n\\n*   ![Image 9: kia kokalitcheva.JPG](https://pitchbook.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/57a635e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x1200+0+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-pitchbook-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3b%2Fef%2F4f77177b4ed8846a93aa29c64b24%2Fkia-kokalitcheva-1.jpg)  About[Kia Kokalitcheva](https://pitchbook.com/news/author/kia-kokalitcheva)  Kia Kokalitcheva leads PitchBook’s US venture capital news team and is based in San Francisco.

Not quite yet.\\n\\nWindsurf\\'s CEO and some of its employees also will work with Google in its DeepMind business. The employees will focus on agentic coding.\\n\\n The move became public on Friday. It was the latest example of how technology companies are hiring AI talent to deepen their core agentic engineering talent pool.\\n\\nBaird Equity Research Analyst Colin Sebastian called the deal a way for Google to compete more aggressively with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. It also highlights the importance of speed to market.\\n\\n\"By licensing one of the most enterprise-focused and secure agentic coding tools, Google should be able to enhance Gemini-powered tools and coding assistants with Windsurf capabilities,\" Sebastian wrote. \"[Google Cloud Platform}, presumably, hopes to compete more effectively with Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer. In addition, we assume Google plans to build on Windsurf technology (and the capabilities of its founders) to offer other GenAI and agentic tools to enterprise cloud customers.\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://creatives.sascdn.com/diff/1909/advertiser/458207/BISR-su25-Catamaran-640x480dbl_042a2507-2dd8-468e-b905-9802e8a05fcb.gif)](https://use2.smartadserver.com/click?imgid=40825618&insid=12818060&pgid=669666&fmtid=47606&ckid=3188824518637077737&uii=2242029633533655726&acd=1752499498428&tmstp=9514226076&tgt=%24dt%3d1t%3b%24dma%3d519%3b%24hc&systgt=%24qc%3d1500046475%3b%24ql%3dHigh%3b%24qpc%3d29418%3b%24qpc%3d29*%3b%24qpc%3d294*%3b%24qpc%3d2941*%3b%24qpc%3d29418*%3b%24qt%3d152_1587_7696t%3b%24dma%3d519%3b%24qo%3d6%3b%24b%3d16999%3b%24o%3d12100%3b%24sw%3d800%3b%24sh%3d600&envtype=0&imptype=0&gdpr=0&pgDomain=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mediapost.com%2fpublications%2farticle%2f407361%2fgoogle-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html&cappid=3188824518637077737&scriptid=99340&opid=6a5384bd-0fb3-4ada-a510-d3581757fc79&opdt=1752499498428&bldv=8793&srcfn=diff&reqid=31a7322e-0ef2-4a5c-a1a4-40a46e9481c9&reqdt=1752499498430&eqs=84aed03bc485424a08a7575992ded844a8ab592b&go=https%3a%2f%2fevents.mediapost.com%2fevent%2fretail-tahoe-2025%2fhome)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMoney has been flowing across technology companies. OpenAI recently acquired io, a startup founded by Jony Ive, formerly the chief design officer at Apple. The acquisition, valued at $6.5 billion in an all-stock deal, makes io OpenAI\\'s largest acquisition.\\n\\nApple announced in 2019 that Ive would leave to form an independent design company, but would continue to work with the company. He founded io years later with several former Apple employees, including Evans Hankey, his successor as Apple\\'s top designer, Tang Tan, who led iPhone and Apple Watch design teams, as well as Scott Cannon, who worked on Mac and iPad teams.\\n\\nIve is known for shaping the design of many Apple products such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.\\n\\nGoogle negotiated a deal with Windsurf after talks between OpenAI and Microsoft fell through, _The Wall Street Journal_ reported. OpenAI didn’t want to give Microsoft access to Windsurf’s technology, but under their contract, the _WSJ_ reported Microsoft is entitled to all of the startup’s intellectual property.\\n\\nLarge technology companies have started an AI talent war and are not only paying millions for AI startups, but aggressively going after seasoned AI employees.\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO at Meta Platforms, formed a Superintelligence Lab and has spend millions to acquire top talent.\\n\\nMultiple news organizations have reported Meta offered Ruoming Pang, a top engineer at Apple, a $200 million pay package. Pang led Apple\\'s AI models team.\\n\\nAnd as the AI and technology wars rage on, Hollywood has taken notice. This time the stars are OpenAI and Sam Altman, rather than Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook like in “The Social Network.”\\n\\n\"Artificial” is a $40 million Amazon MGM Studio-funded production about OpenAI scheduled to debut next year.\\n\\nAn Elon Musk portrayal has been included, according to [Puck\\'s Matt Belloni, who says he has seen the script](https://puck.news/sam-altman-is-getting-social-network-ed/). _Business Insider_ pointed to the post, which has many parallels between “Artificial” and “The Social Network,” mostly because the drama lies between the founders and company. It is a comedic drama set in the world of AI.\\n\\n*   [](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407361/google-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html# \"Share on Facebook\")\\n*   [](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407361/google-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html# \"Share on LinkedIn\")\\n\\n[acquisition](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/acquisition/), [ad buys](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ad-buys/), [ad campaign](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ad-campaign/), [ai](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ai/), [apple](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/apple/), [artificial intelligence](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/artificial-intelligence/), [cloud computing](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/cloud-computing/), [entertainment](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/entertainment/), [generative ai](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/generative-ai/), [google](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/google/), [licensing](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/licensing/), [m&a](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ma/), [media](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/media/), [media buying](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/media-buying/), [meta](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/meta/), [microsoft](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/microsoft/), [start-ups](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/start-ups/), [technology](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/technology/)\\n\\nComment\\n\\n Next story loading ![Image 8: loading..](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mediapost.com/publications/images/ajax-loader.gif)\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n\\n![Image 9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/images/author_headshot/sullivan_laurie.jpg)\\n[Laurie Sullivan](http://www.mediapost.com/people/lsullivanmediapost) is a writer and editor for MediaPost.

This delay was announced as a measure to conduct further safety testing, a move that underscores OpenAI's commitment to responsible AI deployment. Critics may argue that such delays derail innovation timelines, particularly at a time when competitive pressure is mounting from companies like Moonshot AI, which recently released Kimi K2, a model that already outpaces some existing benchmarks set by OpenAI's previous offerings ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/)).\\n\\nThe strategic necessity of such a delay becomes evident when considering the broader landscape of AI deployment. The release of an open-source model carries inherent risks, especially concerning how it might be used or misused once available to the public. Concerns such as cybersecurity vulnerabilities, the potential for generating harmful content, and the amplification of embedded biases necessitate rigorous safety checks prior to any release ([Topmost Ads](https://topmostads.com/openai-open-model-release-delay-analysis/)). OpenAI's decision to pause, rather than rush to the market, reflects an understanding of these challenges and a prioritization of safety, which may ultimately influence industry standards.\\n\\n### Learn to use AI like a Pro\\n\\nGet the latest AI workflows to boost your productivity and business performance, delivered weekly by expert consultants.

Many in the AI community recognize the importance of thorough safety evaluations, particularly given the irreversible nature of open-source model releases ([Open Tools](https://opentools.ai/news/openai-hits-the-brake-delays-on-open-weight-ai-model)). Furthermore, the indefinite postponement speaks to the complexities inherent in balancing rapid technological advancement with the ethical implications of AI deployment.\\n\\nOpenAI's strategic delay also coincides with internal challenges, including leadership changes, which may have influenced its cautious stance. As the company navigates these internal dynamics, maintaining transparency regarding its progress and decision-making process will be crucial to sustaining trust and support from both the public and its partners. Moreover, this delay, while allowing competitors like Moonshot AI to potentially gain ground, underscores OpenAI's commitment to ensuring that its models, once released, align with ethical standards, thus maintaining its reputation as a leader in responsible AI innovation ([Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/openai-delays-launch-of-open-weight-ai-model-for-additional-safety-testing/articleshow/122401375.cms)).\\n\\nUnderstanding OpenAI's Safety Testing Priorities\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOpenAI's commitment to thorough safety testing underscores a strategic emphasis on mitigating risks associated with powerful AI technologies. Delaying the release of their open-source model, originally scheduled for mid-July 2025, highlights the significant focus on evaluating safety in high-risk areas. This cautious approach demonstrates a profound understanding of the potential societal impact of AI technologies, emphasizing the need to preemptively identify and address issues such as cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the generation of harmful content. CEO Sam Altman’s decision reflects OpenAI's prioritization of not just technological advancement, but responsible and ethical AI deployment. For OpenAI, ensuring that AI models do not inadvertently propagate bias or malicious applications is crucial in maintaining public trust and sector leadership. More information about these developments can be found in the related [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/).\\n\\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the delay of OpenAI’s open-source model also echoes the intensifying competition in the field. OpenAI's proactive measures aim to outpace not just technological advancements but also ensure that safety checks precede any competitive edge. In a market where robust models like Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2 already outperform existing systems, the stakes for a flawless and ethically secure launch are incredibly high.

Stakeholders are closely watching how this decision impacts OpenAI's position and whether it prompts shifts in how AI companies measure success. The emphasis on safety may redefine competitive advantage, as the ability to release responsibly developed AI tools gains importance. OpenAI's stance could influence policy makers and regulators, potentially leading to new guidelines that prioritize thorough safety assessments in AI releases [](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/).\\n\\nOpenAI's Indefinite Delay: Industry and Global Repercussions\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOpenAI's recent decision to indefinitely delay the release of its much-anticipated open-source model has sent ripples through the AI industry, highlighting underlying safety concerns that outweigh the competitive pressures of the market. The move, as reported by TechCrunch, was driven by the necessity for further safety testing and an extensive review of potentially high-risk areas before making the model publicly accessible ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/)). Given the open nature of the model, which contrasts with proprietary models like GPT-5, OpenAI is exercising caution to prevent misuse and unintended consequences that unrestricted access might entail. This cautious approach reflects a growing trend in AI development where safety and ethical implications are prioritized over immediate technological advancements.\\n\\nThe delay by OpenAI comes at a crucial time when the competition in the open-source AI model space is intensifying. Moonshot AI, a notable competitor, has recently launched Kimi K2, a model that is reported to outperform some benchmarks set by GPT-4.1 ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/)). This competitive environment adds pressure on OpenAI to balance between responsible innovation and maintaining its position as a leader in AI technology. While some industry analysts view the delay as a prudent measure prioritizing safety, others speculate on whether strategic and technical challenges within OpenAI have contributed to this decision. Nevertheless, the delay indicates a shift towards more rigorous evaluation protocols in AI deployments, setting a precedent for others in the field.\\n\\nThe ramifications of OpenAI's indefinite delay extend beyond its immediate business implications, resonating on a global scale. Economically, this postponement could allow other companies to seize competitive edges and gain market share, particularly in the burgeoning field of open-source AI models that are accessible to developers worldwide ([Economics Times](https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/openai-delays-launch-of-open-weight-ai-model-for-additional-safety-testing/articleshow/122401375.cms)). Socially, it underscores a budding recognition of the ethical dimensions involved in releasing potent AI models without fortified safety checks, potentially catalyzing discussions and actions towards establishing clearer regulations around AI technologies.\\n\\nPolitically, OpenAI's decision might impact international competition in AI, potentially shifting the balance towards nations that are less stringent with such safety protocols. In particular, this delay could provide opportunities for tech giants in countries like China to advance their open-source capabilities, thus influencing global technological dynamics ([Urbanomics](https://urbanomics.substack.com/p/the-economics-and-geo-politics-of)). This balance between fostering innovation and ensuring security could lead to new policies and regulations governing AI safety, potentially steering other organizations toward similar cautious paths, which might delay the pace of AI progress but concurrently minimize risks associated with rapid technological dissemination.\\n\\nRecommended Tools\\n-----------------\\n\\n### [Davis Stirling](https://opentools.ai/tools/davis-stirling)\\n\\nThe Davis-Stirling Act AI application is temporarily halting its operations owing to baseless copyri...\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\n### [GPT-3 Playground (OpenAI)](https://opentools.ai/tools/gpt-3-playground-openai)\\n\\nOpenAI's Playground is an interactive web interface that allows users to explore, test, and experime...\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\n### [Faraday](https://opentools.ai/tools/faraday)\\n\\nFaraday's AI Safety and Responsible AI page emphasizes a commitment to building a predictive future ...\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\n### [Onlyfakes HuggingFace](https://opentools.ai/tools/onlyfakes-huggingface)\\n\\nRealistic-Vision-v4 is a powerful AI model available on Hugging Face, developed by Onlyfake.

[According to the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/f896c4d9-bab7-40a2-9e67-4058093ce250), the company accelerated an existing security clampdown after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a competing model in January, with OpenAI alleging that DeepSeek improperly copied its models using “distillation” techniques.\\n\\nThe beefed-up security includes “information tenting” policies that limit staff access to sensitive algorithms and new products. For example, during development of OpenAI’s o1 model, only verified team members who had been read into the project could discuss it in shared office spaces, according to the FT.\\n\\nAnd there’s more. OpenAI now isolates proprietary technology in offline computer systems, implements biometric access controls for office areas (it scans employees’ fingerprints), and maintains a “deny-by-default” internet policy requiring explicit approval for external connections, per the report, which further adds that the company has increased physical security at data centers and expanded its cybersecurity personnel.\\n\\nThe changes are said to reflect broader concerns about foreign adversaries attempting to steal OpenAI’s intellectual property, though given the ongoing [poaching wars](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/meta-reportedly-hires-four-more-researchers-from-openai/) amid American AI companies and increasingly frequent [leaks](https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-meta-ai-talent-poaching-spree-leaked-messages/) of CEO Sam Altman’s comments, OpenAI may be attempting to address internal security issues, too.\\n\\nWe’ve reached out to OpenAI for comment.\\n\\nTopics\\n\\n[AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/)\\n\\n![Image 5: Event Logo](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AllStage-2025_Logos_nodate-horiz-v1-color-whiteback.png)\\n\\nJuly 15, 2025\\n\\nBoston, MA\\n\\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond — founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

The decision lands in the middle of a brutal AI arms race, particularly with Meta, which has been aggressively poaching OpenAI talent and championing open-source models like Llama 3.\\n\\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad![Image 4: Loading Pods](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019)Visit Advertiser website[GO TO PAGE](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019#)\\n\\nThe model, which was slated to drop this week, would be OpenAI’s first major open-weight system, meaning developers would be free to download and use the model’s underlying code and data weights to build their own apps, research projects, or commercial tools. But as Altman pointed out, once these models are released, “they can’t be pulled back.” That’s the nature of open-source, and it’s exactly why this delay is raising eyebrows across the AI community.\\n\\n“While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back,” Altman wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on July 11. “This is new for us and we want to get it right.”\\n\\nWhat Does “Open-Weight” Mean, and Why Does It Matter?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn AI, “weights” are the millions of numerical values that act like the model’s brain wiring, allowing it to make connections and decisions. When a company releases a model as “open-weight,” it’s not just sharing a blueprint; it’s giving away the fully functional brain. Developers are free to download it, modify it, and use it for everything from building chatbots and productivity tools to creating deepfakes and other malicious applications.\\n\\nOpen-sourcing models accelerates innovation, but it also raises the risk of misuse, misinformation, and untraceable custom versions. That’s why the decision to delay, while frustrating to many, signals that OpenAI is trying to tread cautiously, especially as criticism around AI safety and “model leaking” intensifies.\\n\\nRumors Swirl: What’s the Real Reason for the Delay?\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAccording to developer chatter online, the delay may have been triggered by a major technical issue discovered just before launch. The rumored model was expected to be smaller than Kimi K2—the new open-weight model from Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI that reportedly clocks in at nearly a trillion parameters—but still “super powerful,” according to early testers. Kimi K2, which is taking on ChatGPT with impressive coding capabilities at a lower price, was released on July 11, the same day as Altman’s announcement.\\n\\nWhile some online speculators blamed the delay on Kimi’s unexpectedly strong performance and a fear of being outshone, there’s no confirmation of that from OpenAI. What is clear is that the company is feeling the pressure to deliver something that is safe, fast, and competitive.\\n\\nThe Meta Factor\\n---------------\\n\\nOpenAI’s delay comes at a time when Meta is eating its lunch, at least in the open-source department. Mark Zuckerberg’s company has released increasingly powerful open-weight models like Llama 3, all while quietly hiring away top OpenAI researchers. The talent war is real, and it’s affecting timelines and strategy across the board.\\n\\nBy delaying this release, OpenAI may be hoping to avoid a flawed launch that could dent its credibility at a critical moment. But it also risks falling further behind Meta, which has already become the go-to platform for developers looking to build with transparent, modifiable AI tools.\\n\\nWhat’s Next?\\n------------\\n\\nOpenAI hasn’t offered a new timeline for the release. That silence is fueling speculation that the delay could last weeks. If retraining is truly on the table, it could push the launch closer to the fall.\\n\\nFor now, the open-source community is in wait-and-see mode. And the question hanging over it all: Can OpenAI deliver a model that is powerful, safe, and competitive enough to match Meta’s momentum and keep the Chinese rivals at bay? In other words, can they get it right before someone else does?\\n\\n[Mark Zuckerberg](https://gizmodo.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg)[META](https://gizmodo.com/tag/meta)[open source](https://gizmodo.com/tag/open-source)[OpenAI](https://gizmodo.com/tag/openai)\\n\\nDaily Newsletter\\n----------------\\n\\nGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nNews from the future, delivered to your present.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\\n\\nSign me up\\n\\nLeave this field empty if you\\'re human:  \\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n-----------------\\n\\n*   [![Image 5: Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025.](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/elon-musk-white-house-feb-11-2025-GettyImages-2198395928-copy.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Elon Musk’s Nazi Robot Just Landed a Contract With the Department of Defense ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- xAI said it would be \"turning shovels into tokens.\"](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986) By [Matt Novak](https://gizmodo.com/author/mattnovak) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 6: Mark Zuckerberg speaks at an event in San Francisco](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Mark-Zuckerberg-Speaks-at-an-event-in-San-Francisco.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Meta Is Building Massive Gigawatt Data Centers as It Pours Billions Into AI --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,” Mark Zuckerberg said.](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918) By [AJ Dellinger](https://gizmodo.com/author/ajdellinger1) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 7](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/06/5643db31ce5c5a480c18ffb53bed1c80.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/humans-are-starting-to-talk-more-like-chatgpt-study-claims-2000628916)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Humans Are Starting to Talk More Like ChatGPT, Study Claims ----------------------------------------------------------- AI isn’t just getting into your writing.

CEO Sam Altman said Friday the company is delaying the release of its open model, which was [already pushed back a month](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/openais-open-model-is-delayed/) earlier in this summer. OpenAI had planned to release the model next week, however Altman said the company is pushing it back indefinitely for further safety testing.\\n\\n“We need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us,” said Altman in a [post on X](https://x.com/sama/status/1943837550369812814). “While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back. This is new for us and we want to get it right.”\\n\\nOpenAI’s open model release is one of the most highly anticipated AI events of the summer, alongside the ChatGPT-maker’s expected release of GPT-5. Through these launches, OpenAI will attempt to maintain its spot as Silicon Valley’s leading AI lab — an increasingly difficult tasks as xAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic invest billions of dollars in their own efforts.\\n\\nThe delay means developers will have to wait a little longer to try the first open model OpenAI has released in years. TechCrunch previously reported that OpenAI’s open model is expected to have similar reasoning capabilities to the company’s o-series of models, and that [OpenAI planned for it to be best-in-class](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/openai-seeks-to-make-its-upcoming-open-ai-model-best-in-class/) compared to other open models.\\n\\nThe ecosystem of open AI models became a little more competitive this week. Earlier on Friday, Chinese AI startup [Moonshot AI launched Kimi K2,](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/) a one trillion parameter open AI model that outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 AI model on several agentic-coding benchmarks.\\n\\nIn June, when Altman announced the initial delays around OpenAI’s open model, he noted that the company had achieved something “[unexpected and quite amazing,](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/openais-open-model-is-delayed/)” but didn’t elaborate on what that was.\\n\\n“Capability wise, we think the model is phenomenal — but our bar for an open source model is high and we think we need some more time to make sure we’re releasing a model we’re proud of along every axis,” said Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, in a [post on X](https://x.com/_aidan_clark_/status/1943842131136983378) Friday.\\n\\nTechcrunch event\\n\\n### Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass\\n\\n#### Build smarter.

CEO Sam Altman stated that the delay is to allow for further safety tests and a review of high-risk areas, with no confirmed timeline for the release. The open model, which is eagerly anticipated, will be available for developers to freely download and use locally, distinguishing it from OpenAI’s other proprietary models. This move is part of OpenAI’s strategy to maintain its position as a leading AI lab amidst growing competition from companies like xAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. Recently, Moonshot AI, a Chinese startup, launched Kimi K2, a one-trillion-parameter model that reportedly surpasses OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 on several benchmarks. Despite the delays, OpenAI’s VP of Research, Aidan Clark, emphasized the company’s commitment to releasing a model that meets their high standards for open-source AI.\\n\\n#### Tags:\\n\\n[AI

Global Sales VP Graham Moreno will serve as president.\\n\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2016%209'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2016%209'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nFounded in 2021, Windsurf, formerly known as Codeium, [raised](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/openai-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-windsurf-for-about-3-billion) over $200 million in venture capital from Greenoaks Capital Partners, AIX Ventures, and other investors. A deal with General Catalyst last year valued the AI coding platform at $1.25 billion; the two companies eventually attempted a $3 billion valuation with Kleiner Perkins.\\n\\nWindsurf agreed to an acquisition by OpenAI at that price earlier this year, but the deal reportedly collapsed over concerns that Microsoft would gain Windsurf's intellectual property. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI grants it access to the ChatGPT-maker's technology. Buying Windsurf would have helped OpenAI compete with generative AI coding platforms like Microsoft-owned GitHub.\\n\\nThe move by Google is the latest example of a tech giant poaching top talent from a startup without acquiring the company outright. Microsoft, Meta, and other firms have recently made similar deals, likely using the tactic to avoid antitrust scrutiny.\\n\\n#### // Related Stories\\n\\nAlso read: [The rise of AI coding tools: Is English the hot new programming language?](https://www.techspot.com/news/105912-rise-ai-coding-tools-english-hot-new-programming.html)\\n\\nProgramming is one of the areas that has seen the most disruption from generative AI. Companies like Windsurf claim that large language models can enable users to write code more quickly than ever using natural language prompts.\\n\\nIndustry figures, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and legendary programmer John Carmack, have hailed AI as a fundamental shift in software design. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently [admitted](https://www.techspot.com/news/107749-ceo-satya-nadella-up-30-microsoft-code-now.html) that AI now writes around 30% of the company's code, while CTO Kevin Scott [boasted](https://www.techspot.com/news/107411-microsoft-cto-predicts-ai-generate-95-percent-code.html) that 95% of code will come from AI by 2030.\\n\\nHowever, critics claim that the technology is prone to error and remains inept at certain tasks. A recent paper from the AI research group METR [states](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) that, although developers and experts claim the technology speeds up coding by between 10% and 50%, it actually makes programmers about 19% slower.\\n\\n### Featured on TechSpot\\n\\n![facebook]()\\n![steam]()\\n![youtube]()\\n![twitter]()\\n![rss]()\\n\\n[About](/about/)\\n[Ethics Statement](/ethics.html)\\n[Terms of Use](/terms.html)\\n[Privacy Policy](/privacy.html)\\nManage Ad Consent\\n\\nTECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers\\n\\nTechSpot is a registered trademark and may not be used by third parties without express written permission.\\n\\nTechSpot is represented by [Future PLC](https://go.future-advertising.com/TechSpot-Media-Kit.html).

developers](https://gagadget.com/en/660491-google-scuppers-3bn-openai-deal-by-buying-key-technology-and-developers/)\\n\\nGoogle scuppers $3bn OpenAI deal by buying key technology and developers\\n========================================================================\\n\\n By: [Viktor Tsyrfa](https://gagadget.com/en/users/384/all/) | today, 09:43 \\n\\n![Image 1: Google scuppers $3bn OpenAI deal by buying key technology and developers](https://gagadget.com/media/post_big/ChatGPT_Image.png)_Illustrative image. Source: AI_\\n\\n### Here\\'s What We Know\\n\\nOpenAI has started buying Windsurf, a startup that was engaged in promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence. The deal was supposed to be worth $3 billion, which is a lot for a startup; at one time, Instagram cost Facebook $1 billion, and it was considered a lot. But the deal is no longer going to happen.\\n\\nGoogle made a pirate raid, buying out the key employees of the Windsurf startup for $2.4 billion, along with the CEO and non-exclusive intellectual property rights. That is, for what was the core value of the startup.\\n\\nMoreover, such tactics are not illegal, and OpenAI will not be able to sue. Bypassing antitrust laws - without an actual takeover, Google keeps this deal within the anti-trust zones. The trend of \"acqui-hire\" - when you buy brains and zero assets - helps giants avoid regulators.\\n\\n### What is OpenAI\\'s situation?\\n\\nOpenAI has already faced aggressive competitors: recently, Meta has been actively luring promising AI engineers from the company by [offering](https://gagadget.com/en/656395-meta-offers-100-million-to-openai-employees-for-switching-4-have-already-accepted/) 100 million contracts. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly called it an \"invasion of mercenary agents\" and hinted that they were ready to increase payments to retain their team. Now Google has joined this world of sharks. It seems that the unexpected success of OpenAI has led large corporations to follow this small company very closely, quickly intercepting with the \"long dollar\" everything it shows interest in. Such pressure and the companies\\' disparate financial capabilities could lead to a serious crisis and eventual takeover of OpenAI by one of the financial giants.\\n\\n### Context and implications\\n\\nMeta, Microsoft, and Amazon have already used such strategies: Microsoft poached the founder of Inflection, Amazon the Adept team, and Google a year ago CharacterAI.\\n\\nThe FTC under the leadership of Andrew Ferguson continues to investigate the actions of large tech corporations, but has not yet stopped such aqua hires. The million-dollar question: will regulators actively consider informal acquisitions as a threat to competition?\\n\\n**Source:**[gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/how-google-killed-openais-3-billion-deal-without-an-acquisition-2000628693)\\n\\n[Google](https://gagadget.com/en/tags/id171/)\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nLatest

Instead, Google plans to hire Windsurf\\'s CEO and some staff.\\n\\nGoogle has announced a significant deal with AI-coding startup Windsurf, securing a $2.4 billion license to the company\\'s technology while recruiting its CEO and select R&D team into DeepMind. The deal, announced on July 11, 2025, marks a strategic move by Google to bolster its position in the rapidly evolving AI coding landscape [1].\\n\\nWindsurf, which reached a $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April 2025, had attracted major suitors due to its rapid growth. The startup\\'s technology has been in high demand, with companies like OpenAI and Google vying for its capabilities. However, OpenAI\\'s $3 billion bid to acquire Windsurf reportedly fell apart due to contract renegotiations with Microsoft, which already holds access to OpenAI\\'s intellectual property [2].\\n\\nFollowing the leadership exits, Jeff Wang, Windsurf\\'s head of business, has stepped in as interim CEO. Most of the 250-person team will continue focusing on enterprise AI coding tools, but the company\\'s long-term trajectory remains uncertain. Similar reverse-acquihire startups like Scale AI and Inflection have struggled to maintain momentum post-deal [1].\\n\\nThe deal is expected to significantly boost Google\\'s ability to build AI coding tools, as the company aims to stay competitive in the AI race. As AI model providers increasingly focus on offering AI coding applications to entice developers, Google\\'s acquisition of Windsurf\\'s talent and technology positions it well to capitalize on this trend [1].\\n\\nGoogle\\'s $2.4 billion \\'acquihire\\' gambit comes on the heels of the collapse of OpenAI\\'s acquisition of Windsurf, which was reportedly blocked by a Microsoft IP rights objection. The original deal stalled because Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, objected to the terms. Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI entitles it to the startup’s intellectual property, but OpenAI was unwilling to grant it access to Windsurf’s tech [2].\\n\\nThis incident lays bare the inherent tensions in the OpenAI-Microsoft relationship. While Microsoft’s investment has been crucial for OpenAI’s access to capital and computing power, the strings attached can clearly limit its strategic freedom. For OpenAI, the inability to acquire a key asset like Windsurf without ceding its IP to its main partner—and in this case, competitor—is a significant strategic blow [2].\\n\\nThe AI talent war continues to escalate, but this move signals a new level of strategic complexity. It’s no longer just about poaching individual researchers with massive pay packages, as seen in the recent Meta-OpenAI skirmishes. Now, the battles are being fought over entire teams, intellectual property rights, and the very structure of corporate partnerships [2].\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n[1] https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/\\n\\n[2] https://winbuzzer.com/2025/07/12/googles-2-4b-windsurf-deal-followed-openai-collapse-over-microsoft-ip-veto-xcxwbn/\\n\\n![Image 8: OpenAI Ends Acquisition Talks with Windsurf Over Microsoft IP Concerns](https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1afa886381ed1002.png)\\n\\nAsk Aime: *Why did OpenAI end its acquisition talks with Windsurf?*\\n\\n[View Source](https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/openai-ends-acquisition-talks-with-windsurf-information-reports-thefly?mod=mw_quote_news)\\n\\n![Image 9: whatsapp](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/whats.a186d888.png)\\n\\nWhatsapp\\n\\n![Image 10: link](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/link.5ef2f16a.png)\\n\\nLink\\n\\n![Image 11: x](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/twitter.2dcb9532.png)\\n\\nX\\n\\n![Image 12: facebook](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/facebook.2c4171b5.png)\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n![Image 13: linkedin](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/linkedin.decd6a36.png)\\n\\nLinkedin\\n\\n![Image 14: Aime Insights](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/aimeIcon.f9bef261.png)\\nAime Insights\\n-------------\\n\\nWhat impact does Elon Musk\\'s denial of xAI fundraising have on Tesla\\'s stock price?\\n\\nHow might the XRP ETF launches affect institutional investors?\\n\\nIn light of these events, what are the investment strategies for investors looking to capitalize on emerging AI trends?\\n\\nWhat are the implications of Ripple\\'s banking license for XRP\\'s future?\\n\\nTop News\\n\\n[Elon Musk Denies xAI Fundraising Amid $200 Billion Valuation Speculation Coin World 10h ago ![Image 15: Elon Musk Denies xAI Fundraising Amid $200 Billion Valuation Speculation](https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1afa1c6dfd138001.png)](https://www.ainvest.com/news/elon-musk-denies-xai-fundraising-200-billion-valuation-speculation-2507/ \"Elon Musk Denies xAI Fundraising Amid $200 Billion Valuation Speculation\")[Fed Chair Powell Faces Pressure Amid Resignation Speculation Coin World 16h ago ![Image 16: Fed Chair Powell Faces Pressure Amid Resignation Speculation](https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1af9c6b5ab020001.png)](https://www.ainvest.com/news/fed-chair-powell-faces-pressure-resignation-speculation-2507/ \"Fed Chair Powell Faces Pressure Amid Resignation Speculation\")[Coinbase partners with Perplexity AI to deliver real-time market data -

Not quite yet.\\n\\nWindsurf\\'s CEO and some of its employees also will work with Google in its DeepMind business. The employees will focus on agentic coding.\\n\\n The move became public on Friday. It was the latest example of how technology companies are hiring AI talent to deepen their core agentic engineering talent pool.\\n\\nBaird Equity Research Analyst Colin Sebastian called the deal a way for Google to compete more aggressively with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. It also highlights the importance of speed to market.\\n\\n\"By licensing one of the most enterprise-focused and secure agentic coding tools, Google should be able to enhance Gemini-powered tools and coding assistants with Windsurf capabilities,\" Sebastian wrote. \"[Google Cloud Platform}, presumably, hopes to compete more effectively with Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer. In addition, we assume Google plans to build on Windsurf technology (and the capabilities of its founders) to offer other GenAI and agentic tools to enterprise cloud customers.\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://creatives.sascdn.com/diff/1909/advertiser/458207/BISR-su25-Catamaran-640x480dbl_042a2507-2dd8-468e-b905-9802e8a05fcb.gif)](https://use2.smartadserver.com/click?imgid=40825618&insid=12818060&pgid=669666&fmtid=47606&ckid=3188824518637077737&uii=2242029633533655726&acd=1752499498428&tmstp=9514226076&tgt=%24dt%3d1t%3b%24dma%3d519%3b%24hc&systgt=%24qc%3d1500046475%3b%24ql%3dHigh%3b%24qpc%3d29418%3b%24qpc%3d29*%3b%24qpc%3d294*%3b%24qpc%3d2941*%3b%24qpc%3d29418*%3b%24qt%3d152_1587_7696t%3b%24dma%3d519%3b%24qo%3d6%3b%24b%3d16999%3b%24o%3d12100%3b%24sw%3d800%3b%24sh%3d600&envtype=0&imptype=0&gdpr=0&pgDomain=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mediapost.com%2fpublications%2farticle%2f407361%2fgoogle-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html&cappid=3188824518637077737&scriptid=99340&opid=6a5384bd-0fb3-4ada-a510-d3581757fc79&opdt=1752499498428&bldv=8793&srcfn=diff&reqid=31a7322e-0ef2-4a5c-a1a4-40a46e9481c9&reqdt=1752499498430&eqs=84aed03bc485424a08a7575992ded844a8ab592b&go=https%3a%2f%2fevents.mediapost.com%2fevent%2fretail-tahoe-2025%2fhome)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMoney has been flowing across technology companies. OpenAI recently acquired io, a startup founded by Jony Ive, formerly the chief design officer at Apple. The acquisition, valued at $6.5 billion in an all-stock deal, makes io OpenAI\\'s largest acquisition.\\n\\nApple announced in 2019 that Ive would leave to form an independent design company, but would continue to work with the company. He founded io years later with several former Apple employees, including Evans Hankey, his successor as Apple\\'s top designer, Tang Tan, who led iPhone and Apple Watch design teams, as well as Scott Cannon, who worked on Mac and iPad teams.\\n\\nIve is known for shaping the design of many Apple products such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.\\n\\nGoogle negotiated a deal with Windsurf after talks between OpenAI and Microsoft fell through, _The Wall Street Journal_ reported. OpenAI didn’t want to give Microsoft access to Windsurf’s technology, but under their contract, the _WSJ_ reported Microsoft is entitled to all of the startup’s intellectual property.\\n\\nLarge technology companies have started an AI talent war and are not only paying millions for AI startups, but aggressively going after seasoned AI employees.\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO at Meta Platforms, formed a Superintelligence Lab and has spend millions to acquire top talent.\\n\\nMultiple news organizations have reported Meta offered Ruoming Pang, a top engineer at Apple, a $200 million pay package. Pang led Apple\\'s AI models team.\\n\\nAnd as the AI and technology wars rage on, Hollywood has taken notice. This time the stars are OpenAI and Sam Altman, rather than Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook like in “The Social Network.”\\n\\n\"Artificial” is a $40 million Amazon MGM Studio-funded production about OpenAI scheduled to debut next year.\\n\\nAn Elon Musk portrayal has been included, according to [Puck\\'s Matt Belloni, who says he has seen the script](https://puck.news/sam-altman-is-getting-social-network-ed/). _Business Insider_ pointed to the post, which has many parallels between “Artificial” and “The Social Network,” mostly because the drama lies between the founders and company. It is a comedic drama set in the world of AI.\\n\\n*   [](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407361/google-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html# \"Share on Facebook\")\\n*   [](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407361/google-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html# \"Share on LinkedIn\")\\n\\n[acquisition](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/acquisition/), [ad buys](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ad-buys/), [ad campaign](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ad-campaign/), [ai](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ai/), [apple](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/apple/), [artificial intelligence](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/artificial-intelligence/), [cloud computing](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/cloud-computing/), [entertainment](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/entertainment/), [generative ai](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/generative-ai/), [google](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/google/), [licensing](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/licensing/), [m&a](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ma/), [media](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/media/), [media buying](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/media-buying/), [meta](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/meta/), [microsoft](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/microsoft/), [start-ups](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/start-ups/), [technology](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/technology/)\\n\\nComment\\n\\n Next story loading ![Image 8: loading..](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mediapost.com/publications/images/ajax-loader.gif)\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n\\n![Image 9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/images/author_headshot/sullivan_laurie.jpg)\\n[Laurie Sullivan](http://www.mediapost.com/people/lsullivanmediapost) is a writer and editor for MediaPost.

The decision lands in the middle of a brutal AI arms race, particularly with Meta, which has been aggressively poaching OpenAI talent and championing open-source models like Llama 3.\\n\\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad![Image 4: Loading Pods](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019)Visit Advertiser website[GO TO PAGE](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019#)\\n\\nThe model, which was slated to drop this week, would be OpenAI’s first major open-weight system, meaning developers would be free to download and use the model’s underlying code and data weights to build their own apps, research projects, or commercial tools. But as Altman pointed out, once these models are released, “they can’t be pulled back.” That’s the nature of open-source, and it’s exactly why this delay is raising eyebrows across the AI community.\\n\\n“While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back,” Altman wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on July 11. “This is new for us and we want to get it right.”\\n\\nWhat Does “Open-Weight” Mean, and Why Does It Matter?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn AI, “weights” are the millions of numerical values that act like the model’s brain wiring, allowing it to make connections and decisions. When a company releases a model as “open-weight,” it’s not just sharing a blueprint; it’s giving away the fully functional brain. Developers are free to download it, modify it, and use it for everything from building chatbots and productivity tools to creating deepfakes and other malicious applications.\\n\\nOpen-sourcing models accelerates innovation, but it also raises the risk of misuse, misinformation, and untraceable custom versions. That’s why the decision to delay, while frustrating to many, signals that OpenAI is trying to tread cautiously, especially as criticism around AI safety and “model leaking” intensifies.\\n\\nRumors Swirl: What’s the Real Reason for the Delay?\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAccording to developer chatter online, the delay may have been triggered by a major technical issue discovered just before launch. The rumored model was expected to be smaller than Kimi K2—the new open-weight model from Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI that reportedly clocks in at nearly a trillion parameters—but still “super powerful,” according to early testers. Kimi K2, which is taking on ChatGPT with impressive coding capabilities at a lower price, was released on July 11, the same day as Altman’s announcement.\\n\\nWhile some online speculators blamed the delay on Kimi’s unexpectedly strong performance and a fear of being outshone, there’s no confirmation of that from OpenAI. What is clear is that the company is feeling the pressure to deliver something that is safe, fast, and competitive.\\n\\nThe Meta Factor\\n---------------\\n\\nOpenAI’s delay comes at a time when Meta is eating its lunch, at least in the open-source department. Mark Zuckerberg’s company has released increasingly powerful open-weight models like Llama 3, all while quietly hiring away top OpenAI researchers. The talent war is real, and it’s affecting timelines and strategy across the board.\\n\\nBy delaying this release, OpenAI may be hoping to avoid a flawed launch that could dent its credibility at a critical moment. But it also risks falling further behind Meta, which has already become the go-to platform for developers looking to build with transparent, modifiable AI tools.\\n\\nWhat’s Next?\\n------------\\n\\nOpenAI hasn’t offered a new timeline for the release. That silence is fueling speculation that the delay could last weeks. If retraining is truly on the table, it could push the launch closer to the fall.\\n\\nFor now, the open-source community is in wait-and-see mode. And the question hanging over it all: Can OpenAI deliver a model that is powerful, safe, and competitive enough to match Meta’s momentum and keep the Chinese rivals at bay? In other words, can they get it right before someone else does?\\n\\n[Mark Zuckerberg](https://gizmodo.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg)[META](https://gizmodo.com/tag/meta)[open source](https://gizmodo.com/tag/open-source)[OpenAI](https://gizmodo.com/tag/openai)\\n\\nDaily Newsletter\\n----------------\\n\\nGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nNews from the future, delivered to your present.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\\n\\nSign me up\\n\\nLeave this field empty if you\\'re human:  \\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n-----------------\\n\\n*   [![Image 5: Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025.](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/elon-musk-white-house-feb-11-2025-GettyImages-2198395928-copy.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Elon Musk’s Nazi Robot Just Landed a Contract With the Department of Defense ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- xAI said it would be \"turning shovels into tokens.\"](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986) By [Matt Novak](https://gizmodo.com/author/mattnovak) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 6: Mark Zuckerberg speaks at an event in San Francisco](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Mark-Zuckerberg-Speaks-at-an-event-in-San-Francisco.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Meta Is Building Massive Gigawatt Data Centers as It Pours Billions Into AI --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,” Mark Zuckerberg said.](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918) By [AJ Dellinger](https://gizmodo.com/author/ajdellinger1) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 7](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/06/5643db31ce5c5a480c18ffb53bed1c80.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/humans-are-starting-to-talk-more-like-chatgpt-study-claims-2000628916)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Humans Are Starting to Talk More Like ChatGPT, Study Claims ----------------------------------------------------------- AI isn’t just getting into your writing.

SSD self-destruct demo in action with smoke and circuitry.\\n\\n[Computex YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGzQIzuuvXI&t=56s)/[TeamGroup official website](https://industrial.teamgroupinc.com/en/products-detail/p250q-m80/)\\n\\n“This message will self-destruct in 3… 2… 1” is something you’ve definitely seen in Mission: Impossible films over the years.\\n\\nNow, we finally have tech that feels just as futuristic, thanks to a new kind of storage hardware.\\n\\nTaiwanese company TeamGroup has unveiled a new internal SSD that can literally destroy itself at the press of a button, ensuring sensitive data never falls into the wrong hands.\\n\\nThe device, called the P250Q-M80, is aimed at sectors where top-tier data security isn’t just a perk, it’s a necessity. We’re talking defense, industrial automation, AI development, and maybe even the crypto wallet you hold.\\n\\nTeamGroup showcased the drive at Computex 2025, where it took home a Best Choice Award in the cybersecurity category.\\n\\nHigh-speed storage with safeguards\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nAt the core of the P250Q-M80 is a dedicated self-destruction circuit, which can be triggered in two ways.\\n\\nA short press initiates a software-level wipe that erases all stored data while keeping the drive functional. It even includes an auto-resume feature, which kicks in if the power is cut mid-wipe, finishing the job when power returns.\\n\\nBut the real highlight is the hardware-level data kill switch.\\n\\nHolding the external red button for 5 to 10 seconds sends a high-voltage surge directly into the NAND flash chips, physically destroying them. A multi-stage [LED](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/china-advances-next-gen-lighting-stable-perovskite-led) system provides visual confirmation of the process.\\n\\nTeamGroup even demonstrated the feature on Computex’s official YouTube channel, complete with a puff of smoke. Check it out below –\\n\\nThe [self-destruction](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/dissolvable-battery-developed-with-probiotics) process is irreversible. Once triggered, the drive is permanently bricked.\\n\\nEven physical possession of the hardware won’t allow any chance of recovery, making it a viable last-resort option for those handling highly sensitive material.\\n\\nUsers can even wire the system to an external button completely separate from the PC, allowing a manual, real-time trigger if the situation demands it.\\n\\nIt’s a feature built for high-risk scenarios like field operations, high-level corporate espionage, or any situation where irreversible data destruction is the safest course.\\n\\nBuilt for extreme environments\\n------------------------------\\n\\nWhile the P250Q-M80 leans into drama with its self-destruct feature, it doesn’t skimp on specs.\\n\\nThe drive uses a PCIe Gen4x4 interface and NVMe 1.4 protocol, delivering up to 7,000 MB/s read and 5,500 MB/s write speeds. Storage options range from 256GB to 2TB, with 3D TLC NAND flash onboard.\\n\\n#### RECOMMENDED ARTICLES\\n\\n[](https://www.outbrain.com/what-is/default/en)\\n\\nEngineered for industrial use, the SSD meets military standards for shock and [vibration](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/laser-tech-detects-buried-landmines-us) resistance, and can operate across extreme temperatures.\\n\\nThe company also holds a US patent for its wide-temperature operation tech, which allows it to adjust transfer speeds across thermal zones to maintain stability and performance.\\n\\nThe P250Q-M80 also includes S.M.A.R.T. health monitoring to help users track drive health over time, assuming, of course, the drive hasn’t been deliberately obliterated.\\n\\nTeamGroup hasn’t disclosed pricing or availability yet.\\n\\nBut for those working in high-stakes environments, or just paranoid enough to want a literal red button next to their data, the P250Q-M80 brings an entirely new meaning to “data protection.”\\n\\n0 COMMENT\\n\\n#### ABOUT THE AUTHOR\\n\\n[**Aamir Khollam**](https://interestingengineering.com/author/aamir-khollam-2) Aamir is a seasoned tech journalist with experience at Exhibit Magazine, Republic World, and PR Newswire.

Closed models keep their underlying code private. Meta executives have long argued it is better for the technology to be built in public so that A.I. development will move faster and be accessible to more developers.\\n\\nAny move toward a closed A.I. model would be a philosophical change at Meta as much as a technical one. Meta has won plaudits from developers for open sourcing its A.I. models and one of its top A.I. executives, Yann LeCun, had said “the platform that will win will be the open one.” This year, the Chinese A.I. company DeepSeek released an advanced A.I. chatbot thanks [in part to Meta’s open source code](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/meta-deepseek-ai-open-source.html).\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-superintelligence-lab-ai.html#after-story-ad-1)\\n\\nMeta had finished feeding in data to improve its Behemoth model, a process known as “training,” but has delayed its release because of poor internal performance, said the people with knowledge of the matter, who were not authorized to discuss private conversations. After the company announced the formation of the superintelligence lab last month, teams working on the Behemoth model — which is known as a “frontier” model — stopped running new tests on it, one of the people said.\\n\\nThe superintelligence lab’s discussions are preliminary and no decisions have been made on potential changes, which would need sign-off from Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive. Meta could keep its open source A.I. models while prioritizing a closed model. If these scenarios happen, they would be a significant shift for the company as it tries to stay competitive in the A.I. race against rivals like Google, OpenAI and Anthropic.\\n\\n[Subscribe to The

members of [Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/30/meta-restructures-its-ai-unit-under-superintelligence-labs/)discussed pivoting away from the company’s powerful open-source AI model, Behemoth, and instead developing a closed model, [reports The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-superintelligence-lab-ai.html).\\n\\nSources told The Times that Meta had completed training on Behemoth, but delayed its release due to underwhelming internal performance. When the new Superintelligence Lab launched, testing on the model reportedly halted.\\n\\nThe discussions are just that – discussions. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg would still need to sign off on any changes, and a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Meta’s position on open source AI is “unchanged.”\\n\\n“We plan to continue releasing leading open source models,” the spokesperson said. “We haven’t released everything we’ve developed historically and we expect to continue training a mix of open and closed models going forward.”\\n\\nThe spokesperson did not comment on Meta’s potential shift away from Behemoth. If that happens so that Meta can prioritize closed-source models, it would mark a major philosophical change for the company.\\n\\nWhile Meta deploys more advanced closed-source models internally, like those powering its Meta AI assistant, Zuckerberg had made [open source](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/22/what-does-open-source-ai-mean-anyway/) a central part of the company’s external AI strategy — a way to keep AI development moving faster. He loudly positioned the [Llama family’s](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/metas-recruiting-blitz-claims-three-openai-researchers/) openness as a differentiator from competitors like OpenAI, which Zuckerberg [publicly criticized](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/zuckerberg-disses-closed-source-ai-competitors-as-trying-to-create-god/) for becoming more closed after partnering with Microsoft. But Meta is under pressure to monetize beyond ads as it pours billions into AI.\\n\\nThat includes paying massive signing bonuses and nine-figure salaries to poach top researchers, building out new data centers, and covering the enormous costs of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), or “superintelligence.”\\n\\nTechcrunch event\\n\\n### Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass\\n\\n#### Build smarter.

Past comments from Zuckerberg hint at an ambivalence toward committing to open sourcing Meta’s models. On a [podcast](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/mark-zuckerberg?open=false#%C2%A7dangers-of-open-source) last summer, he said:\\n\\n> “We’re obviously very pro open source, but I haven’t committed to releasing every single thing that we do. I’m basically very inclined to think that open sourcing is going to be good for the community and also good for us because we’ll benefit from the innovations.If at some point, however, there’s some qualitative change in what the thing is capable of, and we feel like it’s not responsible to open source it, then we won’t. It’s all very difficult to predict.”\\n\\nClosed models would give Meta more control and more ways to monetize – especially if it believes the talent it has acquired can deliver competitive, best-in-class performance.\\n\\nSuch a shift could also reshape the AI landscape. Open-source momentum, largely driven by Meta and models like Llama, could slow, even as OpenAI gears up to release its [still-delayed open model](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/). Power could swing back toward the major players with closed ecosystems, while open-source development might remain a product of grassroots efforts. The ripple effects would continue across the startup ecosystem, especially for smaller companies focused on fine-turning, safety, and model alignment that rely on access to open foundation models.\\n\\nOn the world stage, Meta’s retreat from open source could potentially cede ground to China, which has embraced open-source AI – like DeepSeek and [Moonshot AI](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/chinas-moonshot-ai-releases-open-source-model-reclaim-market-position-2025-07-11/) – as a way to build domestic capability and global influence.\\n\\nTopics\\n\\n[AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [AI](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai/), [Llama](https://techcrunch.com/tag/llama/), [Meta](https://techcrunch.com/tag/meta/), [open source ai](https://techcrunch.com/tag/open-source-ai/)\\n\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F14%2Fmeta-built-its-ai-reputation-on-openness-that-may-be-changing%2F)[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F14%2Fmeta-built-its-ai-reputation-on-openness-that-may-be-changing%2F&text=Meta+built+its+AI+reputation+on+openness+%E2%80%94+that+may+be+changing&via=techcrunch)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F14%2Fmeta-built-its-ai-reputation-on-openness-that-may-be-changing%2F&title=Meta+built+its+AI+reputation+on+openness+%E2%80%94+that+may+be+changing&summary=Top+members+of+Meta%E2%80%99s+new+Superintelligence+Lab+discussed+pivoting+away+from+the+company%E2%80%99s+powerful+open+source+AI+model%2C+Behemoth%2C+and+instead+developing+a+closed+model.+This+would+mark+a+major+philosophical+shift+for+Meta.+&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F14%2Fmeta-built-its-ai-reputation-on-openness-that-may-be-changing%2F&title=Meta+built+its+AI+reputation+on+openness+%E2%80%94+that+may+be+changing)[](mailto:?subject=Meta+built+its+AI+reputation+on+openness+%E2%80%94+that+may+be+changing&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F07%2F14%2Fmeta-built-its-ai-reputation-on-openness-that-may-be-changing%2F)[](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/meta-built-its-ai-reputation-on-openness-that-may-be-changing/)\\n\\n![Image 4: Rebecca Bellan](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bellan-rebecca-contributor-copy.jpg?w=150)\\n\\n Rebecca Bellan \\n\\nSenior Reporter\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan)[](https://bsky.app/profile/rebeccabellan.bsky.social)\\n\\nRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

The company’s long drift into for-profit-dom is [coming to a head](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/05/20/openai-profit-pivot). And as the company still at the center of the generative AI boom, OpenAI’s structural pivots and alliance shifts have implications for the rest of the industry.\\n\\n“This is going to be a very, very interesting next 12 to 18 months because of all these dynamics,” Ritu Jyoti, group VP at market intelligence firm IDC, told Tech Brew.\\n\\n**History of change:** Having gathered top research minds in the AI space from day one, OpenAI has always encompassed a series of competing and evolving visions for what the next generation of AI should look like.\\n\\nThat was one of the takeaways Tyler Johnston, executive director of the nonprofit Midas Project, arrived at as he spent the past several months sifting through more than 200 news articles, legal filings, employee testimonials, and other information about OpenAI’s history. The group recently published the result of this work as a research report called the [OpenAI Files](https://www.openaifiles.org/) in partnership with advocacy group Tech Oversight Project.\\n\\n“OpenAI is a company that has existed on this insanely accelerated lifespan,” Johnston told us. “It’s just astonishing how much has happened in the 10 years that it’s existed, and how many different visions of the organization have, at various times, flourished or been squashed based on how convenient they were to the leadership at the time.”\\n\\nBacked by big-name investors and co-founded by Sam Altman and Elon Musk, among others, OpenAI immediately made a splash upon its launch in 2015 as a nonprofit. The lab had already assembled a laundry list of top researchers, with the not-for-profit purpose as part of the recruiting pitch, according to a [Wired feature](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/) at the time.\\n\\n“We just talked about every specific structure and thought this one had the most advantages,” Altman told [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/12/sam-altman-elon-musk-openai) of the nonprofit mission. “I think that the misaligned incentives [of profit-seeking] would be suboptimal to the world as a whole.”\\n\\n**_Some_~~non~~profit:** OpenAI once again grabbed headlines in 2019 when it declared it would not release the full second iteration of its generative pre-trained transformer model (GPT-2) due to “concerns about malicious applications of the technology.” The model was capable of producing “synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality.”\\n\\nA month later, OpenAI converted to a capped profit structure, where returns beyond 100 times an investment would be passed to the nonprofit board. A few months after that, Microsoft invested $1 billion to kick off a “multiyear partnership.”\\n\\n“This was brilliant, by Microsoft, by [CEO] Satya [Nadella],” Vasant Dhar, a data science professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and author of a [forthcoming book](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Machines-Brave-New-World/dp/1394359055) on the history of AI, told Tech Brew. “He just saw this thing coming, you know, from much further away than most people did, and he clinched a really solid deal.”\\n\\n**Frenemy era?** But as OpenAI perhaps continues down its path toward full for-profit status—despite some pushback and potential setbacks—experts we talked with say Microsoft and OpenAI were destined to drift apart eventually. The companies have reportedly clashed over their revenue-sharing agreement and OpenAI’s proposed acquisition of coding platform Windsurf. (The deal ultimately fell through when [Google swooped in](https://www.theverge.com/openai/705999/google-windsurf-ceo-openai) with a shock acquihire of top Windsurf employees.) OpenAI has signed competing cloud agreements, and Microsoft has rolled out competing models.\\n\\nMicrosoft and OpenAI said in a joint statement emailed to Tech Brew that they “have a long-term, productive partnership” and are “optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” a statement also provided to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-dueling-over-artificial-general-intelligence-information-2025-06-25/), and others. In a [January blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/), Microsoft reiterated that its partnership would continue with OpenAI through 2030, while also softening its cloud exclusivity terms.\\n\\nPart of the tension, too, hinges on language around the original agreement, which ends when OpenAI achieves what its board determines to be [AGI](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/resources/glossary/agi), which it defines as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” But AGI does not have a single agreed-upon definition, and that’s [reportedly caused](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/) rifts as well.\\n\\n“That is fundamentally a very, very slippery thing to base your benchmark on, especially as over the past 50 years, we’ve kind of continuously redefined what AGI looks like in practice,” Rowan Curran, principal analyst with Forrester Research, told us.\\n\\nWhile the pressure campaign to keep OpenAI a nonprofit appeared to [notch a win](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/) earlier this year, Johnston argued that the framing of the story was misleading.\\n\\n“In my mind, OpenAI is very conveniently describing control in such a way that they retain a lot of the freedom that they wanted…while still acting as if they had made a concession,” Johnston said.\\n\\nBut an eventual Microsoft-OpenAI split could also be a boon for the overall ecosystem and the companies that are using this technology as it spurs new competition, Jyoti said.\\n\\n“It would diversify the AI providers—it will not be just centered around Microsoft and OpenAI. It will create some new alliances,” Jyoti said. “It will give developers and enterprises more choice, but it can also [add] more complexity.”\\n\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=facebook_share)[](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20company%20is%20drifting%20from%20its%20longtime%20backer%20and%20toward%20for-profit%20status%E2%80%94but%20not%20without%20resistance.&url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=twitter_share&via=MorningBrew)[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=linkedin_share)\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n### Keep up with the innovative tech transforming business\\n\\nTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n![Image 11: logo](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/images/brand-logo-stacked.svg)\\n\\n[About Tech Brew](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/about?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[About Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Advertise with us](https://morningbrewdaily.typeform.com/to/EFVlafWE?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Shop](https://shop.morningbrew.com/?utm_source=mb_main_site&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=main_site_top_nav?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Careers](https://morningbrewinc.com/careers-and-culture?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[FAQ](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/faq?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[](https://www.retailbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.hr-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.marketingbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.cfobrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.revenuebrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.itbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.healthcare-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nIndustry news By Morning brew Inc.\\n\\n© 2025[Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nAll Rights Reserved.\\n\\n[Privacy](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Terms of Service](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/terms-service?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Do Not Sell / Share My Personal Information](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)Cookie Preferences\\n'}], 'OpenAI의 10주년 맞이 정책 변화와 향후 비즈니스 모델 전망': [{'title': 'Nearing its 10th anniversary, OpenAI is at a crossroads -

A few months after that, Microsoft invested $1 billion to kick off a “multiyear partnership.”\\n\\n“This was brilliant, by Microsoft, by [CEO] Satya [Nadella],” Vasant Dhar, a data science professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and author of a [forthcoming book](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Machines-Brave-New-World/dp/1394359055) on the history of AI, told Tech Brew. “He just saw this thing coming, you know, from much further away than most people did, and he clinched a really solid deal.”\\n\\n**Frenemy era?** But as OpenAI perhaps continues down its path toward full for-profit status—despite some pushback and potential setbacks—experts we talked with say Microsoft and OpenAI were destined to drift apart eventually. The companies have reportedly clashed over their revenue-sharing agreement and OpenAI’s proposed acquisition of coding platform Windsurf. (The deal ultimately fell through when [Google swooped in](https://www.theverge.com/openai/705999/google-windsurf-ceo-openai) with a shock acquihire of top Windsurf employees.) OpenAI has signed competing cloud agreements, and Microsoft has rolled out competing models.\\n\\nMicrosoft and OpenAI said in a joint statement emailed to Tech Brew that they “have a long-term, productive partnership” and are “optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” a statement also provided to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-dueling-over-artificial-general-intelligence-information-2025-06-25/), and others. In a [January blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/), Microsoft reiterated that its partnership would continue with OpenAI through 2030, while also softening its cloud exclusivity terms.\\n\\nPart of the tension, too, hinges on language around the original agreement, which ends when OpenAI achieves what its board determines to be [AGI](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/resources/glossary/agi), which it defines as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” But AGI does not have a single agreed-upon definition, and that’s [reportedly caused](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/) rifts as well.\\n\\n“That is fundamentally a very, very slippery thing to base your benchmark on, especially as over the past 50 years, we’ve kind of continuously redefined what AGI looks like in practice,” Rowan Curran, principal analyst with Forrester Research, told us.\\n\\nWhile the pressure campaign to keep OpenAI a nonprofit appeared to [notch a win](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/) earlier this year, Johnston argued that the framing of the story was misleading.\\n\\n“In my mind, OpenAI is very conveniently describing control in such a way that they retain a lot of the freedom that they wanted…while still acting as if they had made a concession,” Johnston said.\\n\\nBut an eventual Microsoft-OpenAI split could also be a boon for the overall ecosystem and the companies that are using this technology as it spurs new competition, Jyoti said.\\n\\n“It would diversify the AI providers—it will not be just centered around Microsoft and OpenAI. It will create some new alliances,” Jyoti said. “It will give developers and enterprises more choice, but it can also [add] more complexity.”\\n\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=facebook_share)[](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20company%20is%20drifting%20from%20its%20longtime%20backer%20and%20toward%20for-profit%20status%E2%80%94but%20not%20without%20resistance.&url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=twitter_share&via=MorningBrew)[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=linkedin_share)\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n### Keep up with the innovative tech transforming business\\n\\nTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n![Image 11: logo](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/images/brand-logo-stacked.svg)\\n\\n[About Tech Brew](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/about?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[About Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Advertise with us](https://morningbrewdaily.typeform.com/to/EFVlafWE?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Shop](https://shop.morningbrew.com/?utm_source=mb_main_site&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=main_site_top_nav?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Careers](https://morningbrewinc.com/careers-and-culture?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[FAQ](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/faq?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[](https://www.retailbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.hr-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.marketingbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.cfobrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.revenuebrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.itbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.healthcare-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nIndustry news By Morning brew Inc.\\n\\n© 2025[Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nAll Rights Reserved.\\n\\n[Privacy](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Terms of Service](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/terms-service?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Do Not Sell / Share My Personal Information](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)Cookie Preferences\\n'}, {'title': 'OpenAI Hits Pause on Its Meta Killer -

The decision lands in the middle of a brutal AI arms race, particularly with Meta, which has been aggressively poaching OpenAI talent and championing open-source models like Llama 3.\\n\\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad![Image 4: Loading Pods](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019)Visit Advertiser website[GO TO PAGE](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019#)\\n\\nThe model, which was slated to drop this week, would be OpenAI’s first major open-weight system, meaning developers would be free to download and use the model’s underlying code and data weights to build their own apps, research projects, or commercial tools. But as Altman pointed out, once these models are released, “they can’t be pulled back.” That’s the nature of open-source, and it’s exactly why this delay is raising eyebrows across the AI community.\\n\\n“While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back,” Altman wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on July 11. “This is new for us and we want to get it right.”\\n\\nWhat Does “Open-Weight” Mean, and Why Does It Matter?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn AI, “weights” are the millions of numerical values that act like the model’s brain wiring, allowing it to make connections and decisions. When a company releases a model as “open-weight,” it’s not just sharing a blueprint; it’s giving away the fully functional brain. Developers are free to download it, modify it, and use it for everything from building chatbots and productivity tools to creating deepfakes and other malicious applications.\\n\\nOpen-sourcing models accelerates innovation, but it also raises the risk of misuse, misinformation, and untraceable custom versions. That’s why the decision to delay, while frustrating to many, signals that OpenAI is trying to tread cautiously, especially as criticism around AI safety and “model leaking” intensifies.\\n\\nRumors Swirl: What’s the Real Reason for the Delay?\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAccording to developer chatter online, the delay may have been triggered by a major technical issue discovered just before launch. The rumored model was expected to be smaller than Kimi K2—the new open-weight model from Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI that reportedly clocks in at nearly a trillion parameters—but still “super powerful,” according to early testers. Kimi K2, which is taking on ChatGPT with impressive coding capabilities at a lower price, was released on July 11, the same day as Altman’s announcement.\\n\\nWhile some online speculators blamed the delay on Kimi’s unexpectedly strong performance and a fear of being outshone, there’s no confirmation of that from OpenAI. What is clear is that the company is feeling the pressure to deliver something that is safe, fast, and competitive.\\n\\nThe Meta Factor\\n---------------\\n\\nOpenAI’s delay comes at a time when Meta is eating its lunch, at least in the open-source department. Mark Zuckerberg’s company has released increasingly powerful open-weight models like Llama 3, all while quietly hiring away top OpenAI researchers. The talent war is real, and it’s affecting timelines and strategy across the board.\\n\\nBy delaying this release, OpenAI may be hoping to avoid a flawed launch that could dent its credibility at a critical moment. But it also risks falling further behind Meta, which has already become the go-to platform for developers looking to build with transparent, modifiable AI tools.\\n\\nWhat’s Next?\\n------------\\n\\nOpenAI hasn’t offered a new timeline for the release. That silence is fueling speculation that the delay could last weeks. If retraining is truly on the table, it could push the launch closer to the fall.\\n\\nFor now, the open-source community is in wait-and-see mode. And the question hanging over it all: Can OpenAI deliver a model that is powerful, safe, and competitive enough to match Meta’s momentum and keep the Chinese rivals at bay? In other words, can they get it right before someone else does?\\n\\n[Mark Zuckerberg](https://gizmodo.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg)[META](https://gizmodo.com/tag/meta)[open source](https://gizmodo.com/tag/open-source)[OpenAI](https://gizmodo.com/tag/openai)\\n\\nDaily Newsletter\\n----------------\\n\\nGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nNews from the future, delivered to your present.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\\n\\nSign me up\\n\\nLeave this field empty if you\\'re human:  \\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n-----------------\\n\\n*   [![Image 5: Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025.](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/elon-musk-white-house-feb-11-2025-GettyImages-2198395928-copy.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Elon Musk’s Nazi Robot Just Landed a Contract With the Department of Defense ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- xAI said it would be \"turning shovels into tokens.\"](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986) By [Matt Novak](https://gizmodo.com/author/mattnovak) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 6: Mark Zuckerberg speaks at an event in San Francisco](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Mark-Zuckerberg-Speaks-at-an-event-in-San-Francisco.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Meta Is Building Massive Gigawatt Data Centers as It Pours Billions Into AI --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,” Mark Zuckerberg said.](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918) By [AJ Dellinger](https://gizmodo.com/author/ajdellinger1) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 7](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/06/5643db31ce5c5a480c18ffb53bed1c80.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/humans-are-starting-to-talk-more-like-chatgpt-study-claims-2000628916)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Humans Are Starting to Talk More Like ChatGPT, Study Claims ----------------------------------------------------------- AI isn’t just getting into your writing.

Many experts speculate that internal strategic disagreements and valuation concerns might have played a role in the acquisition's failure, although specific details remain under wraps. Furthermore, the shift of WindSurf's CEO is seen as a strategic maneuver by Google to bolster its capabilities in emerging tech sectors.\\n\\nPublic reactions have been mixed, with some expressing excitement over the potential innovations that could arise from this change, particularly at Google.

Someone responded with a [Photoshop edit](https://x.com/hypoparams/status/1939761545946309097) of the man’s name (Jiahui Yu) and his former team’s logo (known as “[the Blossom](https://openai.com/brand/),” apparently) on a stock image of a burning LeBron James jersey, as one does. A few days later, TBPN called similar attention to “BREAKING NEWS” about a “FREE AGENT” of note. “Daniel Gross has entered the trade portal,”[read that dispatch](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLp3calJna1/?img_index=1). “Rumors say he’s taking his talents to Meta.”\\n\\nFor many of the world’s most specialized performers, and also for the organizations angling to snag them, ’tis the season to try something new. In the NBA, for example, Kevin Durant took a quick break from [throwing elbows online](https://www.theringer.com/2025/06/30/pop-culture/beef-ranking-best-celebrity-feuds) to move to the Houston Rockets via “the [most complex trade](https://sports.yahoo.com/article/kevin-durant-responds-post-being-233634656.html) in NBA history.” In the NHL, Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner decamped for the Vegas Golden Knights, though not without[threats of litigation](https://sports.yahoo.com/article/happen-ufa-mitch-marner-vegas-184007701.html). (No need to Photoshop [_that_ burning jersey](https://torontosun.com/sports/hockey/nhl/toronto-maple-leafs/embarrassed-fan-burns-jersey-game-5-loss)!) In the midst of all this sports news, though, the wide world of _nerds_—[covered](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/technology-brothers-seized-silicon-valley) by outlets like TBPN, which stands, [cheekily](https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039139792-What-does-ESPN-stand-for#:~:text=When%20ESPN%20started%20in%201979,Network%20(thus,%20ESPN).), for Technology Business Programming Network—has been where the real action is.\\n\\nYu and Gross are just two artificial intelligence experts who’ve been poached by the tech monolith Meta recently as part of a broader competitive escalation across the still-nascent sector. Call it the summer of free AI-gency! Or, if that’s too cringe, you can put it like _The_ _Wall Street Journal_ did at the [end of last month](https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-ai-recruiting-mark-zuckerberg-openai-018ed7fc): “With this spending bonanza and frenzy of movement, AI geeks are being treated more like NBA free agents.”\\n\\nBack in late May, OpenAI, the ambitious operation behind ChatGPT that we at _The Ringer_[last checked in on](https://www.theringer.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-reinstated-ceo-board-directors-microsoft) about a year and a half ago, proudly[paid $6.5 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/technology/openai-jony-ive-deal.html) to acquire a startup launched by one of Apple’s most famous former employees, designer Jony Ive. (The project, [skeptically described](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-and-jony-ives-chatgpt-device-is-probably-going-to-look-like-an-ipod-shuffle-you-can-wear-around-your-neck-report-reveals-more-about-the-hyped-ai-hardware) by _TechRadar_ as an AI-driven wearable akin to “an iPod Shuffle you can wear around your neck,”[hit legal snags](https://www.fastcompany.com/91356722/io-vs-iyo-the-way-your-company-sounds-really-does-matter) almost immediately but is now reportedly[back on track](https://www.theverge.com/news/703114/openai-io-jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-hardware).) In mid-June, Meta spent more than twice that amount—$14.3 billion, its [largest outside investment ever](https://fortune.com/2025/06/22/inside-rise-scale-alexandr-wang-meta-zuckerberg-14-billion-deal-acquihire-ai-supremacy-race/)—for a 49 percent share in a controversial data labeling company called Scale AI. As part of the deal, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg installed Scale’s ascendent 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, [as the head](https://x.com/alexandr_wang/status/1939867404252979291) of Meta’s new “Superintelligence Lab.” A few days later,[OpenAI’s ruthless leader](https://www.theringer.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-reinstated-ceo-board-directors-microsoft), Sam Altman, mentioned on his brother’s podcast that Meta had been going after _his_ roster of workers, too.\\n\\nAccording to Altman, his competitor was offering front-loaded, bonus-laden compensation packages worth “$100 million” in certain cases. “So far, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,” Altman bragged on the pod. Even so, enough OpenAI staffers _did_ make the leap that a company exec compared the experience to being the victim of [a home invasion](https://futurism.com/openai-shutting-down-week).\\n\\n**Newsletter**\\nYep, we have one too\\n\\nBy submitting, you agree to our [Terms](https://www.theringer.com/terms-and-conditions) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.theringer.com/privacy-policy).\\n\\nEarlier this week, OpenAI began striking back,[plucking employees](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-new-hires-scaling/) from Meta, Tesla, and xAI to help scale its business. _For a price_, it’s safe to assume.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSpeaking about the AI talent pool [last December](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24326135/ai-talent-wars-databricks-interview), Naveen Rao, the vice president of AI at the company Databricks, said: “The top-tier researcher side is the hard part. It’s like looking for LeBron James.” Rao was certainly onto something with this choice of comparison.\\n\\n“LMAO,” observed the [influencer](https://x.com/APompliano/status/1940460965121622356) Andrew Pompliano in early July as the battle for niche, generational talent in the emerging tech sector heated up. “AI engineers are getting paid more than LeBron James, Shohei Ohtani, or Juan Soto. Revenge of the nerds.” An entrepreneur named Smit Patel, who describes himself as “Rick Rubin for startup founders” in his online profile,[asked](https://x.com/thesmitpatel/status/1941832599409684562), _First Take_–ishly: “Is Zuck the GOAT of corp dev?” Another onlooker[called Meta](https://x.com/signulll/status/1940089589336875175) “basically the yankees or the dodgers,” warning that now “the world expects rings.” And Sarah Guo, founder of a venture capital firm called Conviction, [wrote that](https://x.com/saranormous/status/1939755089574732133) this labor market land grab was creating secondary opportunities, too. “There are now folks helping researchers negotiate their comp packages and taking a fee,” Guo said. “Like agents for athletes.”\\n\\nEven Altman sounded a bit like an everyday bro yappin’ about sportsball recently when he called out departing OpenAI employees for being driven by compensation rather than pure love of the game. “Missionaries will beat mercenaries,” Altman declared, and for a moment, I felt myself yearning for FanDuel lines on a [mish-merx](https://www.svpg.com/missionaries-vs-mercenaries/) head-to-head. (None exist, but you _can_ participate in[wagers on Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/markets?_q=jony%20ive) like: “Will Jony Ive join Meta before August?”)\\n\\nIt makes sense that professional sports would serve as a recurring motif when discussing the goings-on in AI at the moment. If you squint, the sector’s “race toward AGI”—short for artificial general intelligence, which refers to the attainment of true human-level-or-smarter capabilities—isn’t structured all too differently from the journeys teams make to jockey for a Super Bowl or a Formula One title.\\n\\nSo many colorful, obstinate personalities and idiosyncratic infrastructures to manage! Everyone always talking about chips! Such temperamental swings between swagger and [doom](https://pauseai.info/pdoom)! (James and Ohtani may not have personally threatened to destroy [livelihoods](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-white-collar-job-loss-b9856259?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgUzGfzNlElNgIl-ckjuQvWgatX-GCOSn3CH5o7BlYQJLLRnuHGk6bQVLY60kw%3D&gaa_ts=686fee78&gaa_sig=93Cf9KFSyI6sWev3t7yATtQ70onRfBcYjWK-FBGoyCja_s33AHMS_3AqYj2qDYiXL3p-XxiwpwlVtFMTaosrtw%3D%3D)/fully [upend society](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/16/ai-doom-risk-anthropic-openai-google) just yet, but there’s still plenty of time.) The various companies operating on the frontier of AI research can feel like pro sports franchises sometimes, with their unique strengths and absurd failings and their staffers who have known (and/or despised) one another for the better part of a lifetime, AAU-ball style.\\n\\nApple, for example, is in its rebuild era: cheerfully terrible at making Siri, like, _work_, yet also terribly cheerful about the extent to which its business doesn’t _have_ to revolve around AI. Google is as omniscient and [omnipresent](https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/media/google-ai-tools-depressing-traffic-to-news-sites-report/) as ever, as Walt “Clyde” Frazier might say. Anthropic has a distinct defense-wins-championships devotion to matters like alignment and AI safety. [Thinking Machines Lab](https://www.kron4.com/news/technology-ai/sf-ai-startup-reportedly-dangling-500k-salaries/) is the thinking (wo)man’s choice. xAI, the troubled outfit [behind Grok](https://www.theringer.com/2025/07/09/tech/ai-x-grok-elon-musk-linda-yaccarino-hitler), is [_drowned out by the sound of sirens and circus music_]_._\\n\\nMeta has endless resources,[creepy users](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/06/13/meta-ai-privacy-users-chatbot/), an almost[entirely unfettered](https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/11/19/18099011/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-stock-nyt-wsj) executive, a[mediocre model](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jt4qw2/is_llama_4s_poor_performance_a_meta_problem_or_a/) named Llama, and a history of making up for missing moments by buying better businesses, like Instagram or WhatsApp, outright. OpenAI has a confusing and constrained [ownership structure](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-announce-nonprofit-structure-sam-altman/), a lotta [lore](https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai), and a slate of mostly well-regarded products. (I say “mostly” because one of them was once programmed to be[so over-the-top obsequious](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/chatgpt-chatbot-ai-sycophancy.html) that _even people in tech_ found it off-putting.) In the realm of competition, there’s nothing like a burgeoning top-dog rivalry to make things interesting, and the growing public tension between Altman and Zuckerberg already feels like it could have legs.\\n\\nIn comparison to bigwigs in more buttoned-up industries like investment banking or Big Law, tech leaders have no qualms about doing and saying the kinds of things that most athletes might refer to as “bulletin board material.” And during a recent panel discussion alongside Altman, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap was asked whether he thought Zuckerberg actually believed in Meta’s quest toward “superintelligence” or if he just says so to entice new workers. “I think he believes _he’s_ superintelligent,” Lightcap said.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThere are basically two ways to build teams in sports: You can acquire players through free agency or trades, or you can land fresh talent in the draft. This is true in business, too, as venture capitalist Garry Tan pointed out early this month. “VC firms often overpay for aging LeBrons with max deals at the end of their careers,” [he wrote](https://x.com/garrytan/status/1940136848543953296), “when a better strategy is to take as many first round draft picks as you can.” Tan compared the demo day at Y Combinator—the famed, flawed Bay Area [startup accelerator](https://www.wired.com/story/how-y-combinator-changed-the-world/) that helped bring the world the likes of Airbnb and DoorDash and was, for a time, helmed by Altman—to “the NBA Draft Lottery.”\\n\\nJust like on draft day, sometimes you hit, and sometimes you bust. Wang’s Scale AI, a unicorn tech company whose secret sauce is a global force of human click-workers paid to label data and solve CAPTCHAs, is a Y Combinator success story. But then there’s a place like Dynamo AI: one of several Y Combinator operations that had the ignominious honor of being on the résumé of a grindset grifter named Soham Parekh.\\n\\nParekh recently went viral _not_ for making a hundred million dollars—but rather for somehow managing to get hired for [roughly a hundred million different jobs](https://www.fastcompany.com/91364960/serial-moonlighter-exposed-multiple-startup-jobs). Parekh’s audacious work history, which he admitted to in an exclusive interview on none other than TBPN, included juggling three to four jobs at once; blaming drone strikes for unfinished assignments; and writing cover letters with lines like: “[I am not athletic](https://x.com/anujxforge/status/1942051485367300568/photo/1).” (Respect.) All of this misplaced hustle piqued the attention of one Mark Cuban, who cracked online: “Really excited that the Mavs signed Soham Parekh ! He was kind of under the radar, but I think he is going to do big things starting in Summer League !”\\n\\nCuban was promptly clowned for being days late to the game on that one. But back in the AI big leagues, where people are being paid astonishing sums to work one (1) job at a time, there’s a sense that a lot of the real funny stuff is just getting started. (Both funny-haha, and funny-yeahwe’reallgoingtoworkforthecomputersoneday.) In 2018, a _New York Times_ article was written about the “borderline crazy,” “eye-popping salaries” commanded by AI specialists—salaries said to be in the range of $300,000 to $1.9 million. Just yesterday? Meta poached a top AI builder at Apple for a package [worth a reported $200 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/meta-poached-apple-s-pang-with-pay-package-over-200-million) over a several-year period.\\n\\n“Apple didn’t try to match the offer,” _Bloomberg_ noted, “as it far exceeds pay at the company for leaders other than Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook.”\\n\\nLast week, Cook was among the select few invited to [Allen & Co.’s annual CEO and power broker mogulfest](https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-billionaires-ceos-arriving-sun-valley-idaho-conference-2025-7#michael-eisner-former-disney-ceo-19) in Sun Valley, Idaho (a conference that was a big part of the inspiration for [the “Argestes” episode](https://www.theringer.com/2019/09/17/tv/succession-argestes-real-life-retreats-for-wealthy-davos) of _Succession_). Altman and Zuckerberg were attendees, too. Over the Fourth of July weekend, Zuck posted a video of himself wakeboarding in an inflatable bald eagle suit, unruffled and unbothered. (We all get the [Banana Boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Boat_Team) we deserve.) But Altman [seemed slightly less relaxed](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Q1u-IDobEgE) last Tuesday, as he was being interviewed by a scrum of reporters in front of his Sun Valley hotel like an NFL player during training camp. Wearing a conspicuous pair of Vuarnet sunglasses, Altman said he hadn’t seen Zuck yet but looked forward to it.

developers\\n========================================================================\\n\\n By: [Viktor Tsyrfa](https://gagadget.com/en/users/384/all/) | today, 09:43 \\n\\n![Image 1: Google scuppers $3bn OpenAI deal by buying key technology and developers](https://gagadget.com/media/post_big/ChatGPT_Image.png)_Illustrative image. Source: AI_\\n\\n### Here\\'s What We Know\\n\\nOpenAI has started buying Windsurf, a startup that was engaged in promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence. The deal was supposed to be worth $3 billion, which is a lot for a startup; at one time, Instagram cost Facebook $1 billion, and it was considered a lot. But the deal is no longer going to happen.\\n\\nGoogle made a pirate raid, buying out the key employees of the Windsurf startup for $2.4 billion, along with the CEO and non-exclusive intellectual property rights. That is, for what was the core value of the startup.\\n\\nMoreover, such tactics are not illegal, and OpenAI will not be able to sue. Bypassing antitrust laws - without an actual takeover, Google keeps this deal within the anti-trust zones. The trend of \"acqui-hire\" - when you buy brains and zero assets - helps giants avoid regulators.\\n\\n### What is OpenAI\\'s situation?\\n\\nOpenAI has already faced aggressive competitors: recently, Meta has been actively luring promising AI engineers from the company by [offering](https://gagadget.com/en/656395-meta-offers-100-million-to-openai-employees-for-switching-4-have-already-accepted/) 100 million contracts. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly called it an \"invasion of mercenary agents\" and hinted that they were ready to increase payments to retain their team. Now Google has joined this world of sharks. It seems that the unexpected success of OpenAI has led large corporations to follow this small company very closely, quickly intercepting with the \"long dollar\" everything it shows interest in. Such pressure and the companies\\' disparate financial capabilities could lead to a serious crisis and eventual takeover of OpenAI by one of the financial giants.\\n\\n### Context and implications\\n\\nMeta, Microsoft, and Amazon have already used such strategies: Microsoft poached the founder of Inflection, Amazon the Adept team, and Google a year ago CharacterAI.\\n\\nThe FTC under the leadership of Andrew Ferguson continues to investigate the actions of large tech corporations, but has not yet stopped such aqua hires. The million-dollar question: will regulators actively consider informal acquisitions as a threat to competition?\\n\\n**Source:**[gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/how-google-killed-openais-3-billion-deal-without-an-acquisition-2000628693)\\n\\n[Google](https://gagadget.com/en/tags/id171/)\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nLatest

Its longtime strategic partnership with Microsoft [seems to be fraying](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAhNsJvDhrE7hLskqPqVWDFAM7AyQp-pfwiKlzld1kjVC7CBm7H44hT0ZFxR8qc%3D&gaa_ts=686e6ac3&gaa_sig=eQ8hh5GCya1oYwd-mXwWcvZetrwk-YHOQilAp860cvPJAs0zWNApZZs7UeQQHequ7qfqOMzZkWCshHMfcovfNQ%3D%3D). The company’s long drift into for-profit-dom is [coming to a head](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/05/20/openai-profit-pivot). And as the company still at the center of the generative AI boom, OpenAI’s structural pivots and alliance shifts have implications for the rest of the industry.\\n\\n“This is going to be a very, very interesting next 12 to 18 months because of all these dynamics,” Ritu Jyoti, group VP at market intelligence firm IDC, told Tech Brew.\\n\\n**History of change:** Having gathered top research minds in the AI space from day one, OpenAI has always encompassed a series of competing and evolving visions for what the next generation of AI should look like.\\n\\nThat was one of the takeaways Tyler Johnston, executive director of the nonprofit Midas Project, arrived at as he spent the past several months sifting through more than 200 news articles, legal filings, employee testimonials, and other information about OpenAI’s history. The group recently published the result of this work as a research report called the [OpenAI Files](https://www.openaifiles.org/) in partnership with advocacy group Tech Oversight Project.\\n\\n“OpenAI is a company that has existed on this insanely accelerated lifespan,” Johnston told us. “It’s just astonishing how much has happened in the 10 years that it’s existed, and how many different visions of the organization have, at various times, flourished or been squashed based on how convenient they were to the leadership at the time.”\\n\\nBacked by big-name investors and co-founded by Sam Altman and Elon Musk, among others, OpenAI immediately made a splash upon its launch in 2015 as a nonprofit. The lab had already assembled a laundry list of top researchers, with the not-for-profit purpose as part of the recruiting pitch, according to a [Wired feature](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/) at the time.\\n\\n“We just talked about every specific structure and thought this one had the most advantages,” Altman told [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/12/sam-altman-elon-musk-openai) of the nonprofit mission. “I think that the misaligned incentives [of profit-seeking] would be suboptimal to the world as a whole.”\\n\\n**_Some_~~non~~profit:** OpenAI once again grabbed headlines in 2019 when it declared it would not release the full second iteration of its generative pre-trained transformer model (GPT-2) due to “concerns about malicious applications of the technology.” The model was capable of producing “synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality.”\\n\\nA month later, OpenAI converted to a capped profit structure, where returns beyond 100 times an investment would be passed to the nonprofit board. A few months after that, Microsoft invested $1 billion to kick off a “multiyear partnership.”\\n\\n“This was brilliant, by Microsoft, by [CEO] Satya [Nadella],” Vasant Dhar, a data science professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and author of a [forthcoming book](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Machines-Brave-New-World/dp/1394359055) on the history of AI, told Tech Brew. “He just saw this thing coming, you know, from much further away than most people did, and he clinched a really solid deal.”\\n\\n**Frenemy era?** But as OpenAI perhaps continues down its path toward full for-profit status—despite some pushback and potential setbacks—experts we talked with say Microsoft and OpenAI were destined to drift apart eventually. The companies have reportedly clashed over their revenue-sharing agreement and OpenAI’s proposed acquisition of coding platform Windsurf. (The deal ultimately fell through when [Google swooped in](https://www.theverge.com/openai/705999/google-windsurf-ceo-openai) with a shock acquihire of top Windsurf employees.) OpenAI has signed competing cloud agreements, and Microsoft has rolled out competing models.\\n\\nMicrosoft and OpenAI said in a joint statement emailed to Tech Brew that they “have a long-term, productive partnership” and are “optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” a statement also provided to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-dueling-over-artificial-general-intelligence-information-2025-06-25/), and others. In a [January blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/), Microsoft reiterated that its partnership would continue with OpenAI through 2030, while also softening its cloud exclusivity terms.\\n\\nPart of the tension, too, hinges on language around the original agreement, which ends when OpenAI achieves what its board determines to be [AGI](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/resources/glossary/agi), which it defines as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” But AGI does not have a single agreed-upon definition, and that’s [reportedly caused](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/) rifts as well.\\n\\n“That is fundamentally a very, very slippery thing to base your benchmark on, especially as over the past 50 years, we’ve kind of continuously redefined what AGI looks like in practice,” Rowan Curran, principal analyst with Forrester Research, told us.\\n\\nWhile the pressure campaign to keep OpenAI a nonprofit appeared to [notch a win](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/) earlier this year, Johnston argued that the framing of the story was misleading.\\n\\n“In my mind, OpenAI is very conveniently describing control in such a way that they retain a lot of the freedom that they wanted…while still acting as if they had made a concession,” Johnston said.\\n\\nBut an eventual Microsoft-OpenAI split could also be a boon for the overall ecosystem and the companies that are using this technology as it spurs new competition, Jyoti said.\\n\\n“It would diversify the AI providers—it will not be just centered around Microsoft and OpenAI. It will create some new alliances,” Jyoti said. “It will give developers and enterprises more choice, but it can also [add] more complexity.”\\n\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=facebook_share)[](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20company%20is%20drifting%20from%20its%20longtime%20backer%20and%20toward%20for-profit%20status%E2%80%94but%20not%20without%20resistance.&url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=twitter_share&via=MorningBrew)[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=linkedin_share)\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n### Keep up with the innovative tech transforming business\\n\\nTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n![Image 11: logo](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/images/brand-logo-stacked.svg)\\n\\n[About Tech Brew](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/about?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[About Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Advertise with us](https://morningbrewdaily.typeform.com/to/EFVlafWE?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Shop](https://shop.morningbrew.com/?utm_source=mb_main_site&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=main_site_top_nav?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Careers](https://morningbrewinc.com/careers-and-culture?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[FAQ](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/faq?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[](https://www.retailbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.hr-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.marketingbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.cfobrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.revenuebrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.itbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.healthcare-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nIndustry news By Morning brew Inc.\\n\\n© 2025[Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nAll Rights Reserved.\\n\\n[Privacy](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Terms of Service](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/terms-service?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Do Not Sell / Share My Personal Information](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)Cookie Preferences\\n'}, {'title': 'OpenAI Hits Pause on Its Meta Killer -

The decision lands in the middle of a brutal AI arms race, particularly with Meta, which has been aggressively poaching OpenAI talent and championing open-source models like Llama 3.\\n\\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad![Image 4: Loading Pods](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019)Visit Advertiser website[GO TO PAGE](https://gizmodo.com/openai-hits-pause-on-its-meta-killer-2000629019#)\\n\\nThe model, which was slated to drop this week, would be OpenAI’s first major open-weight system, meaning developers would be free to download and use the model’s underlying code and data weights to build their own apps, research projects, or commercial tools. But as Altman pointed out, once these models are released, “they can’t be pulled back.” That’s the nature of open-source, and it’s exactly why this delay is raising eyebrows across the AI community.\\n\\n“While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back,” Altman wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on July 11. “This is new for us and we want to get it right.”\\n\\nWhat Does “Open-Weight” Mean, and Why Does It Matter?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn AI, “weights” are the millions of numerical values that act like the model’s brain wiring, allowing it to make connections and decisions. When a company releases a model as “open-weight,” it’s not just sharing a blueprint; it’s giving away the fully functional brain. Developers are free to download it, modify it, and use it for everything from building chatbots and productivity tools to creating deepfakes and other malicious applications.\\n\\nOpen-sourcing models accelerates innovation, but it also raises the risk of misuse, misinformation, and untraceable custom versions. That’s why the decision to delay, while frustrating to many, signals that OpenAI is trying to tread cautiously, especially as criticism around AI safety and “model leaking” intensifies.\\n\\nRumors Swirl: What’s the Real Reason for the Delay?\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAccording to developer chatter online, the delay may have been triggered by a major technical issue discovered just before launch. The rumored model was expected to be smaller than Kimi K2—the new open-weight model from Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI that reportedly clocks in at nearly a trillion parameters—but still “super powerful,” according to early testers. Kimi K2, which is taking on ChatGPT with impressive coding capabilities at a lower price, was released on July 11, the same day as Altman’s announcement.\\n\\nWhile some online speculators blamed the delay on Kimi’s unexpectedly strong performance and a fear of being outshone, there’s no confirmation of that from OpenAI. What is clear is that the company is feeling the pressure to deliver something that is safe, fast, and competitive.\\n\\nThe Meta Factor\\n---------------\\n\\nOpenAI’s delay comes at a time when Meta is eating its lunch, at least in the open-source department. Mark Zuckerberg’s company has released increasingly powerful open-weight models like Llama 3, all while quietly hiring away top OpenAI researchers. The talent war is real, and it’s affecting timelines and strategy across the board.\\n\\nBy delaying this release, OpenAI may be hoping to avoid a flawed launch that could dent its credibility at a critical moment. But it also risks falling further behind Meta, which has already become the go-to platform for developers looking to build with transparent, modifiable AI tools.\\n\\nWhat’s Next?\\n------------\\n\\nOpenAI hasn’t offered a new timeline for the release. That silence is fueling speculation that the delay could last weeks. If retraining is truly on the table, it could push the launch closer to the fall.\\n\\nFor now, the open-source community is in wait-and-see mode. And the question hanging over it all: Can OpenAI deliver a model that is powerful, safe, and competitive enough to match Meta’s momentum and keep the Chinese rivals at bay? In other words, can they get it right before someone else does?\\n\\n[Mark Zuckerberg](https://gizmodo.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg)[META](https://gizmodo.com/tag/meta)[open source](https://gizmodo.com/tag/open-source)[OpenAI](https://gizmodo.com/tag/openai)\\n\\nDaily Newsletter\\n----------------\\n\\nGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nNews from the future, delivered to your present.\\n\\n Select - [x]  \\n\\nPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\\n\\nSign me up\\n\\nLeave this field empty if you\\'re human:  \\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n-----------------\\n\\n*   [![Image 5: Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025.](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/elon-musk-white-house-feb-11-2025-GettyImages-2198395928-copy.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Elon Musk’s Nazi Robot Just Landed a Contract With the Department of Defense ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- xAI said it would be \"turning shovels into tokens.\"](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-nazi-robot-just-landed-a-contract-with-the-department-of-defense-2000628986) By [Matt Novak](https://gizmodo.com/author/mattnovak) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 6: Mark Zuckerberg speaks at an event in San Francisco](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Mark-Zuckerberg-Speaks-at-an-event-in-San-Francisco.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Meta Is Building Massive Gigawatt Data Centers as It Pours Billions Into AI --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,” Mark Zuckerberg said.](https://gizmodo.com/meta-is-building-massive-gigawatt-data-centers-as-it-pours-billions-into-ai-2000628918) By [AJ Dellinger](https://gizmodo.com/author/ajdellinger1) Published July 14, 2025    \\n*   [![Image 7](https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/06/5643db31ce5c5a480c18ffb53bed1c80.jpg)](https://gizmodo.com/humans-are-starting-to-talk-more-like-chatgpt-study-claims-2000628916)[Tech News Artificial Intelligence Humans Are Starting to Talk More Like ChatGPT, Study Claims ----------------------------------------------------------- AI isn’t just getting into your writing.

Many experts speculate that internal strategic disagreements and valuation concerns might have played a role in the acquisition's failure, although specific details remain under wraps. Furthermore, the shift of WindSurf's CEO is seen as a strategic maneuver by Google to bolster its capabilities in emerging tech sectors.\\n\\nPublic reactions have been mixed, with some expressing excitement over the potential innovations that could arise from this change, particularly at Google.

developers](https://gagadget.com/en/660491-google-scuppers-3bn-openai-deal-by-buying-key-technology-and-developers/)\\n\\nGoogle scuppers $3bn OpenAI deal by buying key technology and developers\\n========================================================================\\n\\n By: [Viktor Tsyrfa](https://gagadget.com/en/users/384/all/) | today, 09:43 \\n\\n![Image 1: Google scuppers $3bn OpenAI deal by buying key technology and developers](https://gagadget.com/media/post_big/ChatGPT_Image.png)_Illustrative image. Source: AI_\\n\\n### Here\\'s What We Know\\n\\nOpenAI has started buying Windsurf, a startup that was engaged in promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence. The deal was supposed to be worth $3 billion, which is a lot for a startup; at one time, Instagram cost Facebook $1 billion, and it was considered a lot. But the deal is no longer going to happen.\\n\\nGoogle made a pirate raid, buying out the key employees of the Windsurf startup for $2.4 billion, along with the CEO and non-exclusive intellectual property rights. That is, for what was the core value of the startup.\\n\\nMoreover, such tactics are not illegal, and OpenAI will not be able to sue. Bypassing antitrust laws - without an actual takeover, Google keeps this deal within the anti-trust zones. The trend of \"acqui-hire\" - when you buy brains and zero assets - helps giants avoid regulators.\\n\\n### What is OpenAI\\'s situation?\\n\\nOpenAI has already faced aggressive competitors: recently, Meta has been actively luring promising AI engineers from the company by [offering](https://gagadget.com/en/656395-meta-offers-100-million-to-openai-employees-for-switching-4-have-already-accepted/) 100 million contracts. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly called it an \"invasion of mercenary agents\" and hinted that they were ready to increase payments to retain their team. Now Google has joined this world of sharks. It seems that the unexpected success of OpenAI has led large corporations to follow this small company very closely, quickly intercepting with the \"long dollar\" everything it shows interest in. Such pressure and the companies\\' disparate financial capabilities could lead to a serious crisis and eventual takeover of OpenAI by one of the financial giants.\\n\\n### Context and implications\\n\\nMeta, Microsoft, and Amazon have already used such strategies: Microsoft poached the founder of Inflection, Amazon the Adept team, and Google a year ago CharacterAI.\\n\\nThe FTC under the leadership of Andrew Ferguson continues to investigate the actions of large tech corporations, but has not yet stopped such aqua hires. The million-dollar question: will regulators actively consider informal acquisitions as a threat to competition?\\n\\n**Source:**[gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/how-google-killed-openais-3-billion-deal-without-an-acquisition-2000628693)\\n\\n[Google](https://gagadget.com/en/tags/id171/)\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nLatest

Not quite yet.\\n\\nWindsurf\\'s CEO and some of its employees also will work with Google in its DeepMind business. The employees will focus on agentic coding.\\n\\n The move became public on Friday. It was the latest example of how technology companies are hiring AI talent to deepen their core agentic engineering talent pool.\\n\\nBaird Equity Research Analyst Colin Sebastian called the deal a way for Google to compete more aggressively with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. It also highlights the importance of speed to market.\\n\\n\"By licensing one of the most enterprise-focused and secure agentic coding tools, Google should be able to enhance Gemini-powered tools and coding assistants with Windsurf capabilities,\" Sebastian wrote. \"[Google Cloud Platform}, presumably, hopes to compete more effectively with Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer. In addition, we assume Google plans to build on Windsurf technology (and the capabilities of its founders) to offer other GenAI and agentic tools to enterprise cloud customers.\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://creatives.sascdn.com/diff/1909/advertiser/458207/BISR-su25-Catamaran-640x480dbl_042a2507-2dd8-468e-b905-9802e8a05fcb.gif)](https://use2.smartadserver.com/click?imgid=40825618&insid=12818060&pgid=669666&fmtid=47606&ckid=3188824518637077737&uii=2242029633533655726&acd=1752499498428&tmstp=9514226076&tgt=%24dt%3d1t%3b%24dma%3d519%3b%24hc&systgt=%24qc%3d1500046475%3b%24ql%3dHigh%3b%24qpc%3d29418%3b%24qpc%3d29*%3b%24qpc%3d294*%3b%24qpc%3d2941*%3b%24qpc%3d29418*%3b%24qt%3d152_1587_7696t%3b%24dma%3d519%3b%24qo%3d6%3b%24b%3d16999%3b%24o%3d12100%3b%24sw%3d800%3b%24sh%3d600&envtype=0&imptype=0&gdpr=0&pgDomain=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mediapost.com%2fpublications%2farticle%2f407361%2fgoogle-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html&cappid=3188824518637077737&scriptid=99340&opid=6a5384bd-0fb3-4ada-a510-d3581757fc79&opdt=1752499498428&bldv=8793&srcfn=diff&reqid=31a7322e-0ef2-4a5c-a1a4-40a46e9481c9&reqdt=1752499498430&eqs=84aed03bc485424a08a7575992ded844a8ab592b&go=https%3a%2f%2fevents.mediapost.com%2fevent%2fretail-tahoe-2025%2fhome)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMoney has been flowing across technology companies. OpenAI recently acquired io, a startup founded by Jony Ive, formerly the chief design officer at Apple. The acquisition, valued at $6.5 billion in an all-stock deal, makes io OpenAI\\'s largest acquisition.\\n\\nApple announced in 2019 that Ive would leave to form an independent design company, but would continue to work with the company. He founded io years later with several former Apple employees, including Evans Hankey, his successor as Apple\\'s top designer, Tang Tan, who led iPhone and Apple Watch design teams, as well as Scott Cannon, who worked on Mac and iPad teams.\\n\\nIve is known for shaping the design of many Apple products such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.\\n\\nGoogle negotiated a deal with Windsurf after talks between OpenAI and Microsoft fell through, _The Wall Street Journal_ reported. OpenAI didn’t want to give Microsoft access to Windsurf’s technology, but under their contract, the _WSJ_ reported Microsoft is entitled to all of the startup’s intellectual property.\\n\\nLarge technology companies have started an AI talent war and are not only paying millions for AI startups, but aggressively going after seasoned AI employees.\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO at Meta Platforms, formed a Superintelligence Lab and has spend millions to acquire top talent.\\n\\nMultiple news organizations have reported Meta offered Ruoming Pang, a top engineer at Apple, a $200 million pay package. Pang led Apple\\'s AI models team.\\n\\nAnd as the AI and technology wars rage on, Hollywood has taken notice. This time the stars are OpenAI and Sam Altman, rather than Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook like in “The Social Network.”\\n\\n\"Artificial” is a $40 million Amazon MGM Studio-funded production about OpenAI scheduled to debut next year.\\n\\nAn Elon Musk portrayal has been included, according to [Puck\\'s Matt Belloni, who says he has seen the script](https://puck.news/sam-altman-is-getting-social-network-ed/). _Business Insider_ pointed to the post, which has many parallels between “Artificial” and “The Social Network,” mostly because the drama lies between the founders and company. It is a comedic drama set in the world of AI.\\n\\n*   [](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407361/google-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html# \"Share on Facebook\")\\n*   [](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407361/google-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html# \"Share on LinkedIn\")\\n\\n[acquisition](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/acquisition/), [ad buys](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ad-buys/), [ad campaign](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ad-campaign/), [ai](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ai/), [apple](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/apple/), [artificial intelligence](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/artificial-intelligence/), [cloud computing](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/cloud-computing/), [entertainment](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/entertainment/), [generative ai](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/generative-ai/), [google](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/google/), [licensing](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/licensing/), [m&a](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ma/), [media](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/media/), [media buying](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/media-buying/), [meta](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/meta/), [microsoft](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/microsoft/), [start-ups](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/start-ups/), [technology](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/technology/)\\n\\nComment\\n\\n Next story loading ![Image 8: loading..](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mediapost.com/publications/images/ajax-loader.gif)\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n\\n![Image 9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/images/author_headshot/sullivan_laurie.jpg)\\n[Laurie Sullivan](http://www.mediapost.com/people/lsullivanmediapost) is a writer and editor for MediaPost.

developers](https://gagadget.com/en/660491-google-scuppers-3bn-openai-deal-by-buying-key-technology-and-developers/)\\n\\nGoogle scuppers $3bn OpenAI deal by buying key technology and developers\\n========================================================================\\n\\n By: [Viktor Tsyrfa](https://gagadget.com/en/users/384/all/) | today, 09:43 \\n\\n![Image 1: Google scuppers $3bn OpenAI deal by buying key technology and developers](https://gagadget.com/media/post_big/ChatGPT_Image.png)_Illustrative image. Source: AI_\\n\\n### Here\\'s What We Know\\n\\nOpenAI has started buying Windsurf, a startup that was engaged in promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence. The deal was supposed to be worth $3 billion, which is a lot for a startup; at one time, Instagram cost Facebook $1 billion, and it was considered a lot. But the deal is no longer going to happen.\\n\\nGoogle made a pirate raid, buying out the key employees of the Windsurf startup for $2.4 billion, along with the CEO and non-exclusive intellectual property rights. That is, for what was the core value of the startup.\\n\\nMoreover, such tactics are not illegal, and OpenAI will not be able to sue. Bypassing antitrust laws - without an actual takeover, Google keeps this deal within the anti-trust zones. The trend of \"acqui-hire\" - when you buy brains and zero assets - helps giants avoid regulators.\\n\\n### What is OpenAI\\'s situation?\\n\\nOpenAI has already faced aggressive competitors: recently, Meta has been actively luring promising AI engineers from the company by [offering](https://gagadget.com/en/656395-meta-offers-100-million-to-openai-employees-for-switching-4-have-already-accepted/) 100 million contracts. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly called it an \"invasion of mercenary agents\" and hinted that they were ready to increase payments to retain their team. Now Google has joined this world of sharks. It seems that the unexpected success of OpenAI has led large corporations to follow this small company very closely, quickly intercepting with the \"long dollar\" everything it shows interest in. Such pressure and the companies\\' disparate financial capabilities could lead to a serious crisis and eventual takeover of OpenAI by one of the financial giants.\\n\\n### Context and implications\\n\\nMeta, Microsoft, and Amazon have already used such strategies: Microsoft poached the founder of Inflection, Amazon the Adept team, and Google a year ago CharacterAI.\\n\\nThe FTC under the leadership of Andrew Ferguson continues to investigate the actions of large tech corporations, but has not yet stopped such aqua hires. The million-dollar question: will regulators actively consider informal acquisitions as a threat to competition?\\n\\n**Source:**[gizmodo.com](https://gizmodo.com/how-google-killed-openais-3-billion-deal-without-an-acquisition-2000628693)\\n\\n[Google](https://gagadget.com/en/tags/id171/)\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nLatest

Not quite yet.\\n\\nWindsurf\\'s CEO and some of its employees also will work with Google in its DeepMind business. The employees will focus on agentic coding.\\n\\n The move became public on Friday. It was the latest example of how technology companies are hiring AI talent to deepen their core agentic engineering talent pool.\\n\\nBaird Equity Research Analyst Colin Sebastian called the deal a way for Google to compete more aggressively with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. It also highlights the importance of speed to market.\\n\\n\"By licensing one of the most enterprise-focused and secure agentic coding tools, Google should be able to enhance Gemini-powered tools and coding assistants with Windsurf capabilities,\" Sebastian wrote. \"[Google Cloud Platform}, presumably, hopes to compete more effectively with Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer. In addition, we assume Google plans to build on Windsurf technology (and the capabilities of its founders) to offer other GenAI and agentic tools to enterprise cloud customers.\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://creatives.sascdn.com/diff/1909/advertiser/458207/BISR-su25-Catamaran-640x480dbl_042a2507-2dd8-468e-b905-9802e8a05fcb.gif)](https://use2.smartadserver.com/click?imgid=40825618&insid=12818060&pgid=669666&fmtid=47606&ckid=3188824518637077737&uii=2242029633533655726&acd=1752499498428&tmstp=9514226076&tgt=%24dt%3d1t%3b%24dma%3d519%3b%24hc&systgt=%24qc%3d1500046475%3b%24ql%3dHigh%3b%24qpc%3d29418%3b%24qpc%3d29*%3b%24qpc%3d294*%3b%24qpc%3d2941*%3b%24qpc%3d29418*%3b%24qt%3d152_1587_7696t%3b%24dma%3d519%3b%24qo%3d6%3b%24b%3d16999%3b%24o%3d12100%3b%24sw%3d800%3b%24sh%3d600&envtype=0&imptype=0&gdpr=0&pgDomain=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mediapost.com%2fpublications%2farticle%2f407361%2fgoogle-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html&cappid=3188824518637077737&scriptid=99340&opid=6a5384bd-0fb3-4ada-a510-d3581757fc79&opdt=1752499498428&bldv=8793&srcfn=diff&reqid=31a7322e-0ef2-4a5c-a1a4-40a46e9481c9&reqdt=1752499498430&eqs=84aed03bc485424a08a7575992ded844a8ab592b&go=https%3a%2f%2fevents.mediapost.com%2fevent%2fretail-tahoe-2025%2fhome)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMoney has been flowing across technology companies. OpenAI recently acquired io, a startup founded by Jony Ive, formerly the chief design officer at Apple. The acquisition, valued at $6.5 billion in an all-stock deal, makes io OpenAI\\'s largest acquisition.\\n\\nApple announced in 2019 that Ive would leave to form an independent design company, but would continue to work with the company. He founded io years later with several former Apple employees, including Evans Hankey, his successor as Apple\\'s top designer, Tang Tan, who led iPhone and Apple Watch design teams, as well as Scott Cannon, who worked on Mac and iPad teams.\\n\\nIve is known for shaping the design of many Apple products such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.\\n\\nGoogle negotiated a deal with Windsurf after talks between OpenAI and Microsoft fell through, _The Wall Street Journal_ reported. OpenAI didn’t want to give Microsoft access to Windsurf’s technology, but under their contract, the _WSJ_ reported Microsoft is entitled to all of the startup’s intellectual property.\\n\\nLarge technology companies have started an AI talent war and are not only paying millions for AI startups, but aggressively going after seasoned AI employees.\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO at Meta Platforms, formed a Superintelligence Lab and has spend millions to acquire top talent.\\n\\nMultiple news organizations have reported Meta offered Ruoming Pang, a top engineer at Apple, a $200 million pay package. Pang led Apple\\'s AI models team.\\n\\nAnd as the AI and technology wars rage on, Hollywood has taken notice. This time the stars are OpenAI and Sam Altman, rather than Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook like in “The Social Network.”\\n\\n\"Artificial” is a $40 million Amazon MGM Studio-funded production about OpenAI scheduled to debut next year.\\n\\nAn Elon Musk portrayal has been included, according to [Puck\\'s Matt Belloni, who says he has seen the script](https://puck.news/sam-altman-is-getting-social-network-ed/). _Business Insider_ pointed to the post, which has many parallels between “Artificial” and “The Social Network,” mostly because the drama lies between the founders and company. It is a comedic drama set in the world of AI.\\n\\n*   [](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407361/google-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html# \"Share on Facebook\")\\n*   [](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/407361/google-pays-24b-to-license-ai-startup-tech-stu.html# \"Share on LinkedIn\")\\n\\n[acquisition](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/acquisition/), [ad buys](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ad-buys/), [ad campaign](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ad-campaign/), [ai](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ai/), [apple](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/apple/), [artificial intelligence](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/artificial-intelligence/), [cloud computing](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/cloud-computing/), [entertainment](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/entertainment/), [generative ai](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/generative-ai/), [google](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/google/), [licensing](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/licensing/), [m&a](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/ma/), [media](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/media/), [media buying](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/media-buying/), [meta](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/meta/), [microsoft](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/microsoft/), [start-ups](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/start-ups/), [technology](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/tag/technology/)\\n\\nComment\\n\\n Next story loading ![Image 8: loading..](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mediapost.com/publications/images/ajax-loader.gif)\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n\\n![Image 9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/images/author_headshot/sullivan_laurie.jpg)\\n[Laurie Sullivan](http://www.mediapost.com/people/lsullivanmediapost) is a writer and editor for MediaPost.

Its longtime strategic partnership with Microsoft [seems to be fraying](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAhNsJvDhrE7hLskqPqVWDFAM7AyQp-pfwiKlzld1kjVC7CBm7H44hT0ZFxR8qc%3D&gaa_ts=686e6ac3&gaa_sig=eQ8hh5GCya1oYwd-mXwWcvZetrwk-YHOQilAp860cvPJAs0zWNApZZs7UeQQHequ7qfqOMzZkWCshHMfcovfNQ%3D%3D). The company’s long drift into for-profit-dom is [coming to a head](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/05/20/openai-profit-pivot). And as the company still at the center of the generative AI boom, OpenAI’s structural pivots and alliance shifts have implications for the rest of the industry.\\n\\n“This is going to be a very, very interesting next 12 to 18 months because of all these dynamics,” Ritu Jyoti, group VP at market intelligence firm IDC, told Tech Brew.\\n\\n**History of change:** Having gathered top research minds in the AI space from day one, OpenAI has always encompassed a series of competing and evolving visions for what the next generation of AI should look like.\\n\\nThat was one of the takeaways Tyler Johnston, executive director of the nonprofit Midas Project, arrived at as he spent the past several months sifting through more than 200 news articles, legal filings, employee testimonials, and other information about OpenAI’s history. The group recently published the result of this work as a research report called the [OpenAI Files](https://www.openaifiles.org/) in partnership with advocacy group Tech Oversight Project.\\n\\n“OpenAI is a company that has existed on this insanely accelerated lifespan,” Johnston told us. “It’s just astonishing how much has happened in the 10 years that it’s existed, and how many different visions of the organization have, at various times, flourished or been squashed based on how convenient they were to the leadership at the time.”\\n\\nBacked by big-name investors and co-founded by Sam Altman and Elon Musk, among others, OpenAI immediately made a splash upon its launch in 2015 as a nonprofit. The lab had already assembled a laundry list of top researchers, with the not-for-profit purpose as part of the recruiting pitch, according to a [Wired feature](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/) at the time.\\n\\n“We just talked about every specific structure and thought this one had the most advantages,” Altman told [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/12/sam-altman-elon-musk-openai) of the nonprofit mission. “I think that the misaligned incentives [of profit-seeking] would be suboptimal to the world as a whole.”\\n\\n**_Some_~~non~~profit:** OpenAI once again grabbed headlines in 2019 when it declared it would not release the full second iteration of its generative pre-trained transformer model (GPT-2) due to “concerns about malicious applications of the technology.” The model was capable of producing “synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality.”\\n\\nA month later, OpenAI converted to a capped profit structure, where returns beyond 100 times an investment would be passed to the nonprofit board. A few months after that, Microsoft invested $1 billion to kick off a “multiyear partnership.”\\n\\n“This was brilliant, by Microsoft, by [CEO] Satya [Nadella],” Vasant Dhar, a data science professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and author of a [forthcoming book](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Machines-Brave-New-World/dp/1394359055) on the history of AI, told Tech Brew. “He just saw this thing coming, you know, from much further away than most people did, and he clinched a really solid deal.”\\n\\n**Frenemy era?** But as OpenAI perhaps continues down its path toward full for-profit status—despite some pushback and potential setbacks—experts we talked with say Microsoft and OpenAI were destined to drift apart eventually. The companies have reportedly clashed over their revenue-sharing agreement and OpenAI’s proposed acquisition of coding platform Windsurf. (The deal ultimately fell through when [Google swooped in](https://www.theverge.com/openai/705999/google-windsurf-ceo-openai) with a shock acquihire of top Windsurf employees.) OpenAI has signed competing cloud agreements, and Microsoft has rolled out competing models.\\n\\nMicrosoft and OpenAI said in a joint statement emailed to Tech Brew that they “have a long-term, productive partnership” and are “optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” a statement also provided to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-dueling-over-artificial-general-intelligence-information-2025-06-25/), and others. In a [January blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/), Microsoft reiterated that its partnership would continue with OpenAI through 2030, while also softening its cloud exclusivity terms.\\n\\nPart of the tension, too, hinges on language around the original agreement, which ends when OpenAI achieves what its board determines to be [AGI](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/resources/glossary/agi), which it defines as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” But AGI does not have a single agreed-upon definition, and that’s [reportedly caused](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/) rifts as well.\\n\\n“That is fundamentally a very, very slippery thing to base your benchmark on, especially as over the past 50 years, we’ve kind of continuously redefined what AGI looks like in practice,” Rowan Curran, principal analyst with Forrester Research, told us.\\n\\nWhile the pressure campaign to keep OpenAI a nonprofit appeared to [notch a win](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-remain-under-non-profit-control-change-restructuring-plans-2025-05-05/) earlier this year, Johnston argued that the framing of the story was misleading.\\n\\n“In my mind, OpenAI is very conveniently describing control in such a way that they retain a lot of the freedom that they wanted…while still acting as if they had made a concession,” Johnston said.\\n\\nBut an eventual Microsoft-OpenAI split could also be a boon for the overall ecosystem and the companies that are using this technology as it spurs new competition, Jyoti said.\\n\\n“It would diversify the AI providers—it will not be just centered around Microsoft and OpenAI. It will create some new alliances,” Jyoti said. “It will give developers and enterprises more choice, but it can also [add] more complexity.”\\n\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=facebook_share)[](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20company%20is%20drifting%20from%20its%20longtime%20backer%20and%20toward%20for-profit%20status%E2%80%94but%20not%20without%20resistance.&url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=twitter_share&via=MorningBrew)[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/openai-10th-anniversary-crossroads&utm_source=linkedin_share)\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n### Keep up with the innovative tech transforming business\\n\\nTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n![Image 11: logo](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/images/brand-logo-stacked.svg)\\n\\n[About Tech Brew](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/about?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[About Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Advertise with us](https://morningbrewdaily.typeform.com/to/EFVlafWE?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Shop](https://shop.morningbrew.com/?utm_source=mb_main_site&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=main_site_top_nav?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Careers](https://morningbrewinc.com/careers-and-culture?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[FAQ](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/faq?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\n[](https://www.retailbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.hr-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.marketingbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.cfobrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.revenuebrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.itbrew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[](https://www.healthcare-brew.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nIndustry news By Morning brew Inc.\\n\\n© 2025[Morning Brew Inc.](https://morningbrewinc.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)\\n\\nAll Rights Reserved.\\n\\n[Privacy](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Terms of Service](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/terms-service?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)[Do Not Sell / Share My Personal Information](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/privacy?utm_medium=website&utm_source=global_footer&utm_campaign=etb)Cookie Preferences\\n'}], 'ChatGPT의 개인화 기능 발전이 사용자 경험에 미치는 영향': [{'title': 'Say This Simple Phrase to ChatGPT and It Will Never Forget You!

Credit: Freepik | The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel\\n\\n**OpenAI** has introduced a major update to **ChatGPT**, bringing a feature that significantly changes the way users interact with the AI. The latest version of ChatGPT now includes a[**long-term memory**](https://www.theverge.com/news/646968/openai-chatgpt-long-term-memory-upgrade) function, allowing the AI to retain and recall information shared by users across multiple conversations.\\n\\nPreviously, ChatGPT only remembered details within a single conversation, limiting its ability to provide **personalized advice** beyond that interaction. With this new memory feature, ChatGPT can now act more like a **personal assistant**, recalling important facts or preferences to enhance future conversations.\\n\\nThis development brings ChatGPT closer to the role of a long-term assistant. Whether it’s tracking your progress in a **fitness routine**, remembering your **[dietary choices](https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/red-meat-may-be-destroying-your-memory/)**, or even recalling preferences for daily tasks, the new memory functionality improves the AI’s ability to assist with ongoing projects or needs. It allows the AI to adapt and provide more **relevant responses** based on prior discussions.\\n\\n### How to make ChatGPT remember your details\\n\\nTo take advantage of the memory feature, users must explicitly instruct ChatGPT on what information to retain. This is done through a simple phrase: _“Remember that …”_. This prompt is used to provide the AI with key details that users want it to recall in future interactions.\\n\\nFor instance, if a user follows a specific diet, they might tell ChatGPT, _“Remember that I am **vegetarian**.”_ Similarly, if someone is starting a **fitness regimen** after a period of inactivity, they might say, _“Remember that I’m starting a workout routine and I’ve been sedentary for years.”_ Once this information is stored, ChatGPT can recall it when relevant, tailoring its advice, meal suggestions, or fitness tips accordingly. This allows for a more **fluid** and personalized experience over time.\\n\\n### Managing and controlling ChatGPT’s memory\\n\\nThe memory feature is not activated by default. Users need to enable it manually by going to **Settings > Personalization > Memory**, where they can toggle the memory function on. After activation, ChatGPT will begin storing information provided by the user, but it also allows users to maintain control over what is stored.\\n\\nIn the same settings menu, users can manage the stored data by **viewing**, **editing**, or **deleting specific memories**. If a user wishes to remove certain details, they can do so easily. Alternatively, they can choose to clear all stored information at once, ensuring complete control over their interactions with ChatGPT. This flexibility is key to maintaining **privacy** while benefiting from the AI’s long-term memory.\\n\\nThis update marks a significant improvement in how users can engage with **[AI systems](https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/07/ai-evolving-unbelievable-speed-than-sci-fi-icons-like-neal-stephenson-ever-imagined/)**. The ability to make ChatGPT remember important details enhances its **utility**, making it more relevant and responsive over time. It also provides users with greater control over their personal data, allowing them to use the tool in a more secure and tailored manner. As AI technologies continue to evolve, the integration of long-term memory could become a **standard feature** in personal assistants, improving their overall functionality.\\n\\n[Follow us on Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKggKIiRDQklTRlFnTWFoRUtEMlJoYVd4NVoyRnNZWGg1TG1OdmJTZ0FQAQ)\\n\\nRead also :\\n-----------\\n\\n![Image 9: Lord Of The Rings Director Peter Jackson](blob:http://localhost/9df31ea8248a78c65e796d523a6bf07c)\\n\\n[News](https://dailygalaxy.com/category/news/)\\n\\n[Say This Simple Phrase to ChatGPT and It Will Never Forget You!](https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/07/say-this-simple-phrase-to-chatgpt-and-it-will-never-forget-you/)\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 11: Lord Of The Rings Director Peter Jackson](blob:http://localhost/9df31ea8248a78c65e796d523a6bf07c)\\n\\n[News](https://dailygalaxy.com/category/news/)\\n\\n[I Ditched Spotify for Apple Music 4 Years Ago—and Here’s Why I’m Never Going Back](https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/07/i-ditched-spotify-for-apple-music-4-years-ago-and-heres-why-im-never-going-back/)\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 13: Lord Of The Rings Director Peter Jackson](blob:http://localhost/9df31ea8248a78c65e796d523a6bf07c)\\n\\n[News](https://dailygalaxy.com/category/news/)\\n\\n[A Real-Life Jurassic Park?

Here\\'s a side by side of what\\'s to come.\\n\\n![Image 1: Headshot of Blake Stimac](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/97e838f033d312a91e67e8f69dd15d0f70040821/hub/2024/10/01/746531ed-1fb0-44a0-8961-e8e401b5da24/blake-stimac-headshot-0014.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=96&width=96)\\n\\n![Image 2: Headshot of Blake Stimac](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/ef3c65e76acd438e12c78ad6257911188a5edca1/hub/2024/10/01/746531ed-1fb0-44a0-8961-e8e401b5da24/blake-stimac-headshot-0014.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=84&width=84)\\n\\nBlake Stimac Writer\\n\\nBlake has over a decade of experience writing for the web, with a focus on mobile phones, where he covered the smartphone boom of the 2010s and the broader tech scene. When he\\'s not in front of a keyboard, you\\'ll most likely find him playing video games, watching horror flicks, or hunting down a good churro.\\n\\n[See full bio](https://www.cnet.com/profiles/bstimac/)\\n\\nBlake Stimac\\n\\nJuly 14, 2025 2:47 p.m. PT\\n\\n4 min read\\n\\n![Image 3: WWDC 2025 iOS 26](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/159883dbfe1f6e03f07591a3ca3ba778ecfbb727/hub/2025/06/10/c0df5012-76b6-48c3-8402-20adb5a7d86f/wwdc25ios26.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200)\\n\\nLiquid Glass will make your iPhone look different, but the UI is still being refined.\\n\\nApple/CNET\\n\\nApple\\'s new [Liquid Glass](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/liquid-glass-new-photos-app-and-all-the-other-ios-26-features-coming-to-your-iphone/) design language, largely inspired by VisionOS on the [Vision Pro headset](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-vision-pro-review-a-mind-blowing-look-at-an-unfinished-future/), will add both shine and translucency to your devices. So far, we like what we see, but the new styling could look different by the time it\\'s available for your iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices later this year. Brave iPhone users can [install the developer beta right now](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/want-an-early-look-at-ios-26-heres-how-to-get-the-developer-beta/), but the public beta could drop any day.\\n\\nAt first glance, Liquid Glass feels dramatic, but it\\'s more subtle than you might be led to believe. (Visually, at least -- Apple is skipping iOS 19 and the other intervening numbers.) Think of it as touch-up rather than reconstructive surgery with [iOS 26\\'s other, more mundane features](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/forget-the-liquid-glass-design-im-here-for-all-of-ios-26s-humdrum-features/) tucked underneath.\\n\\nLiquid Glass on the home screen is a fairly minimal change, which is a good thing. We\\'re only at the [first developer beta](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apples-ios-26-beta-is-out-now-how-you-can-download-today/) of the new OS and design, though, and Apple will undoubtedly make tweaks until its final release.\\n\\nBelow, we\\'ll take a closer look at both iOS 26 and iOS 18 to see what\\'s different between the two. For more, here are the [iPhone models that will support iOS 26](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/can-your-iphone-run-the-newest-apple-mobile-os-see-all-the-ios-18-compatible-devices/) when it launches.\\n\\nHome screen\\n-----------\\n\\n![Image 4: A side by side of an iPhone using iOS 26 vs iOS 18](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/a9019efcfc021b741b3970cbe5c815f766ec083a/hub/2025/06/13/893e649e-fb3c-4d0d-a32a-3ab1834f54ce/homescreen.png?auto=webp&width=1200)\\n\\nApple kept the new Liquid Glass minimal on the home screen, with only minor changes to the default home screen appearance versus iOS 18\\'s.\\n\\nApple/Screenshot by Jeff Carlson\\n\\nLooking at the home screens, the primary difference you\\'ll find is that in iOS 26 the background of the dock and the search option that sits in between the dock and the home screen icons are more transparent and have a sheen to the edges, whereas in iOS 18, these are slightly darker.\\n\\nOther smaller changes are that the icons on iOS 26 look slightly larger, and some app icons seem to have been more influenced by the redesign than others, most notably (from the screenshots) Settings, Camera and Mail.\\n\\nFor Liquid Glass to really shine on the home screen, you\\'ll want to opt for the \"All Clear\" mode, which will create the most dramatic change to your icons and widgets. Going this route could potentially introduce some viewability issues, but the \"reduce transparency\" setting remedies this quite well.\\n\\nControl Center\\n--------------\\n\\n![Image 5: iOS 26 vs iOS 18 Control Center](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/67f147de9623d6776d4a90ff34b3a68557e87417/hub/2025/06/15/729c3a1d-ea1e-4392-bfd5-efa4e9cf2b0b/2.png?auto=webp&width=1200)\\n\\nApple/Screenshot by Jeff Carlson\\n\\nThings here are largely unchanged. Outside of the new glassy look in iOS 26, the 1x2 and 2x1 controls are more rounded than that of iOS 18.\\n\\nLock screen\\n-----------\\n\\n![Image 6: iOS 26 vs iOS 18 Control Center](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/47e2c8916d721be369b367b9d287f9894d9fbc57/hub/2025/06/15/08e51f91-75c0-4fee-87d4-0a3e9839a94d/3.png?auto=webp&width=1200)\\n\\nApple/Screenshot by Jeff Carlson\\n\\nIt\\'s easy to see the differences that Liquid Glass brings to the lock screen of the iPhone. The digital clock in iOS 26 dynamically resizes depending on the wallpaper and the number of notifications you have at any given moment, which is pretty cool. The clock itself on iOS 18 can be changed, but it won\\'t change in size in response to content displayed on the lock screen.\\n\\nThe background on notifications is clearly different between the two OS versions, with iOS 18 providing more opacity and a black text versus iOS 26\\'s near-transparent background on white text. The controls at the bottom in iOS 26 also appear more like physical buttons with depth and more of a see-through background.\\n\\nThe new unlock effect in iOS 26 is that the motion of unlocking your iPhone will appear as though you\\'re lifting a sheet of glass, highlighted by a shiny edge to give it form when you begin to slide your finger up.\\n\\nMenus and dynamic tab bars\\n--------------------------\\n\\n![Image 7: iOS 26 vs iOS 18 Control Center](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/c2b66b5bd0d5a0cf93b09d4e5ec81e459237a405/hub/2025/06/15/ae1eec6e-b9b1-4de2-885a-c62ddca2d4d8/4.png?auto=webp&width=1200)\\n\\niOS 26\\'s new Dynamic Tab gives you a cleaner look and more space to view your content.\\n\\nApple/Screenshot by Jeff Carlson\\n\\nA new addition in iOS 26 is the introduction of dynamic tab bars in apps that will change depending on whether you\\'re scrolling or trying to perform a specific action. Apple says this will create a more intuitive experience while freeing up space for your content. If you were to replace the glass effect with heavily saturated colors, no one would blame you for mistaking this new tab bar with what [Google\\'s doing in Android 16](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/android-16-heres-everything-google-announced-at-the-android-show-io-edition/) in some of its apps -- they look a lot alike. But compared to iOS 18, this new dynamic tab bar should not only reduce sifting through multiple menus, but it looks pretty good in the process.\\n\\niOS 26 will dynamically adapt to light and dark backgrounds\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn iOS 26, the color of menu icons and icon text will adapt depending on the background.\\n\\nApple/GIF by CNET\\n\\nWhile it\\'s harder to compare Liquid Glass to iOS 18 here, an upcoming feature is that buttons and menus will adapt depending on the content\\'s background color. For instance, when you\\'re scrolling through an app with a light background, the floating menu options will appear with black text for easier viewing and will automatically change to white upon scrolling to a dark background.\\n\\n![Image 8: iOS 18 background colors](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/d192c2a08d52d1e183456094ecabfdd48e995fa5/hub/2025/06/15/548be1b9-ae07-4e05-823a-df3c71a6ce56/7.png?auto=webp&width=1200)\\n\\nin iOS 18, some apps aspects of the user interface would appear darker depending on the color of the background, but less so than how Liquid Glass handles it now.\\n\\nCNET/ Screenshots by Jeff Carlson\\n\\niOS has had this type of feature show up in a less dramatic fashion before, as you can tell from the photos app screenshots above. Comparing these to what\\'s on the horizon, it\\'s hard not to get excited about the small tweaks Liquid Glass has in store, too.\\n\\nThose are just a few of our initial findings, and we\\'ll likely add more once we surface them.

Google은 Windsurf의 CEO 및 핵심 개발자들을 총 24억 달러에 인수하고 해리포터의 마법사가 되어버린 것 같습니다. 이는 OpenAI의 30억 달러 투자 제안을 물거품으로 만들어 놓았으며, 기술 경쟁에서 큰 타격을 입혔습니다. 이와 같은 사례는 최근 IT 업계에서 빈번하게 발생하고 있으며, 기업들이 인재를 확보하기 위해 자원을 쏟아 붓고 있다는 사실을 보여줍니다.\\n\\n### 인재 확보 전쟁: Google의 전략\\n\\nGoogle은 Windsurf의 핵심 인력을 \\'acqui-hire\\' 방식으로 확보하며, 규제를 피해갈 수 있는 전략을 극대화했습니다. 이러한 전략은 금전적으로도 합법적이긴 하지만, OpenAI와 같은 중소기업에게는 치명적인 결과를 초래할 수 있습니다. Windsurf의 CEO가 Google로 이직하자, 업계 전반에 파장이 일어났습니다. 여러 전문가들은 이러한 인재 이동이 기업 간의 경쟁 구조를 어떻게 변화시킬지에 대한 우려를 표명했습니다.\\n\\n![인재 확보 전쟁의 상징적 이미지](https://gagadget.com/media/post_big/ChatGPT_Image.png) (출처: Gagadget)\\n\\n### OpenAI의 위기와 반응\\n\\nOpenAI는 Google의 인재 확보 외에도 Meta로부터의 인재 유출 위협도 받고 있습니다. OpenAI의 CEO인 샘 올트먼은 이러한 상황에 대해 \"용병들의 침략\"이라고 표현하며 팀을 유지하기 위한 보상 인상을 시사했습니다. 그러나 Google과 Meta와 같은 대기업들이 가진 자본력과 인프라를 고려할 때, 중소 AI 스타트업의 입지는 더욱 좁아질 수밖에 없는 상황입니다.\\n\\n### 향후 전망과 전략\\n\\n이러한 경쟁 상황은 OpenAI가 더욱 적극적으로 기술 보호 및 인재 유지를 위한 전략을 수립해야 함을 의미합니다. 특히, 인재를 잃지 않기 위한 보상 및 근무 환경 개선이 필요하며, 슬프게도 이러한 상황에서는 정당한 투자나 인수도 위협이 됩니다. OpenAI는 이를 통해 시장 내 위치를 강화하고, 장기적으로 경쟁력을 유지해야 할 것입니다. \\n\\n결론적으로, 이 모든 변화는 AI 기술의 발전과 기업 간의 경쟁에서 중소 스타트업들에게 심각한 도전으로 작용할 것입니다. OpenAI가 어떻게 대응하느냐에 따라 AI 생태계의 향후 모습이 크게 달라질 수 있습니다. 이러한 역학 관계는 앞으로 더욱 심화될 것으로 예상됩니다.'}}\n",

AI 기술이 고위험 산업에 끼칠 영향력은 물론, 이러한 결정들이 향후 어떻게 발전해 나갈지, 업계 전문가 및 개발자들의 촉각이 곤두서고 있습니다. OpenAI의 결정은 이러한 맥락에서 기업의 포지셔닝 및 지속 가능한 개발을 위한 중요한 전략적 접근임을 시사합니다. \\n\\n결론적으로, AI 시장의 혁신과 안전성 간의 균형을 맞추려는 OpenAI와 메타의 행보가 향후 어떤 귀결을 맺을지, 우리 모두의 관심이 집중되고 있습니다.\\n\\n## OpenAI의 10주년 맞이 정책 변화와 향후 비즈니스 모델 전망\\n## OpenAI의 10주년 맞이 정책 변화와 향후 비즈니스 모델 전망\\n\\nOpenAI가 창립 10주년을 맞이하며 그 방향성이 완전히 달라지고 있는 가운데, 다양한 전략적 변화와 함께 비즈니스 모델에 대한 전망도 주목받고 있습니다. 최근의 여러 보도에 따르면, OpenAI는 비영리에서 영리 기업으로의 전환을 시도하고 있으며, 이 과정에서 주요 파트너십 사랑과 상충하는 내용을 보이고 있습니다.\\n\\n### 전략적 변화의 조짐\\n\\n학교 및 연구 중심의 비영리 연구소에서 세계에서 가장 가치 있는 프라이빗 기업 중 하나로 성장한 OpenAI는 Microsoft와의 전략적 파트너십 역시 긴장 상황에 놓여 있습니다. Microsoft와의 관계가 제기되고 있는 가운데, OpenAI는 최근 Windsurf라는 AI 스타트업의 인수에 나섰으나, Google이 경쟁적으로 인재 및 핵심 기술을 흡수하며 이 거래는 무산되었습니다. 과거에 비해 기업의 강력한 인수합병 전략이 보고되고 있는 상황에서, Google의 공격적인 인수 전략은 OpenAI의 성장 기회를 위협하는 요소로 작용하고 있습니다.\\n\\n![OpenAI CEO Sam Altman](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/108b53b01b893153106c4c9411eba74121daa3b6-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,50,1500,900&w=1000&h=600&q=80&fit=max&auto=format&dpr=1)\\n\\nSam Altman CEO는 OpenAI가 기술적인 고위험 영역에 대한 안전성을 보장하기 위해 지연된 모델 출시와 관련하여 ‘타이밍’을 매우 중요시한다고 밝혔습니다. 이러한 안전성 보장은 OpenAI의 향후 모델이 효과적으로 구현되도록 하는 필수 전략으로 여겨지고 있습니다. \\n\\n### 시장 경쟁과 AI 인재 확보\\n\\nAI 분야에서는 인재 확보전쟁이 거세지고 있습니다. OpenAI는 현재 프로그램 개발자 및 AI 연구원들이 예상치 못한 고액의 보상 제안을 받는 난처한 상황에 처해 있기 때문입니다. 일반적으로 우수한 인재는 연봉 1억 원대 이상의 보수를 받고 있습니다. 이러한\\xa0추세에 따라\\xa0OpenAI는 자사 인재 유치를 위해 제안을 대폭 강화해야 할 필요성을 느끼고 있습니다. \\n\\n![AI 인재 경쟁](https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F07%2FFreeAIgency_Getty-Ringer-scaled.jpg&w=3840&q=75&dpl=08ed0d69ef1f1853fddc97432a4d9d78c4d9593b)\\n\\n현재 Meta는 OpenAI 인재들을 대상으로 공격적인 보상 패키지를 제공하며, OpenAI의 미래를 더욱 불투명하게 만듭니다. Altman CEO는 이러한 상황을 ‘용병들의 침공’으로 비유하며 우수 인재를 잃지 않기 위한 노력을 기울이고 있습니다.\\n\\n### 향후 비즈니스 모델 전망\\n\\nOpenAI의 향후 비즈니스 모델은 보다 경쟁적인 AI 생태계에서의 지속적인 생존과 성장을 목표로 하고 있습니다. 여러 기사를 통해 나타난 바와 같이, OpenAI는 중요한 기술과 인재를 지키기 위해 그들의 전략을 세분화해야 하며, 다른 기업과의 관계에서 어떤 교훈을 얻을지도 중요한 요소입니다. \\n\\n결론적으로, OpenAI의 10주년을 맞이하는 현재의 상황은 기술 혁신의 선두주자로서 지속적으로 발전하기 위한 도전과 기회를 동시에 제공하고 있습니다. 앞으로의 변화와 정책 방향은 업계 전반에 큰 영향을 미칠 것으로 예상되며, 이는 곧 AI 산업의 향후 트렌드를 결정짓는 중요한 요소로 작용할 것입니다.\\n\\n## OpenAI Delay의 영향: 광고업계와의 파트너십에 미치는 변화\\n## OpenAI Delay의 영향: 광고업계와의 파트너십에 미치는 변화\\n\\n최근 OpenAI가 Windsurf라는 AI 스타트업 인수의 계획을 중단하며 광고 및 기술 산업에 큰 변화가 일어나고 있습니다. OpenAI는 원래 30억 달러에 Windsurf를 인수할 예정이었으나, 구글이 막판에 Windsurf의 핵심 인력을 24억 달러에 인수하며 이 계약이 붕괴되었습니다. 이 전략은 약한 기업을 포착하는 \\'아퀴하이어(Acqui-hire)\\' 전술로, 구글은 이로 인해 AI 기술 및 인재의 급속한 확보를 도모하게 되었습니다.\\n\\nOpenAI CEO 샘 알트만은 \"우리는 이제 이러한 환경 속에서 지속적으로 경쟁력을 유지해야 한다\"며, \"업계의 모든 경쟁자들이 빠르게 움직이고 있다\"고 말했습니다. 이는 광고업계에서도 각 기업이 AI를 더욱 효과적으로 활용하기 위한 갈증을 더욱더 키우고 있다는 점을 시사합니다.\\n\\n![OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/108b53b01b893153106c4c9411eba74121daa3b6-1500x1000.jpg)\\n\\n이와 동시에, OpenAI의 타격은 앞으로의 기술 파트너십에도 상당한 영향을 미칠 것으로 보입니다. 여러 전문가들은 구글이 AI 스타트업과 함께 AI 시스템의 안정성과 보안을 높인다면, OpenAI와의 경쟁을 보다 심화시킬 것이라고 예측하고 있습니다. 이로 인해 광고업계의 파트너십 역시 변화하게 될 가능성이 높습니다.\\n\\n서울대학교의 인공지능 연구소 소속 연구원인 김현수 박사는 \"구글의 Windsurf 인수는 단순한 기술 인수 이상의 의미가 있다. 이는 업계에서 경쟁력 있는 AI 툴이 고객이 원하는 효과적인 광고 및 마케팅 솔루션으로 이어질 수 있도록 만든 것\"이라고 분석했습니다. 이처럼 OpenAI의 딜레이는 시장의 패러다임을 변화시키며, 광고업체들이 새로운 AI 파트너십을 고민하게 만들고 있습니다.\\n\\n또한, OpenAI가 메타와 경쟁하고 있는 상황에서, 구글의 발빠른 행보는 더 큰 시장 점유율을 가져다 줄 것으로 예상됩니다. 이는 광고 연동에서 고객 맞춤형 솔루션을 우선적으로 개발해야 하는 여지를 만들어 줄 것이며, 향후 각 광고사의 AI 활용 능력은 더 중요해질 것입니다.\\n\\n결국, OpenAI의 결정은 단순한 기업 변화에 그치지 않을 것이며, 광고업계와의 파트너십에서도 단기적 및 장기적 변화를 요구하게 될 것입니다. 이러한 변화들은 새로운 비즈니스 모델과 혁신적인 서비스 개발로 이어질 가능성이 많습니다.\\n\\n**결론적으로, OpenAI의 Delay는 단순한 기술적인 문제를 넘어 광고업계의 전략적 파트너십에 큰 틀에서 영향을 미칠 것으로 보이며, 이는 다양한 기업들이 AI를 통해 경쟁력을 유지하기 위한 긴박함을 더욱 고조시킬 것입니다.**\\n\\n## Google과의 경쟁에서 OpenAI의 기술 보호 전략 분석\\n## Google과의 경쟁에서 OpenAI의 기술 보호 전략 분석\\n\\n최근 OpenAI는 Windsurf라는 AI 스타트업 인수를 계획했으나 Google의 공격적인 인재 확보 전략에 의해 무산되었습니다. Google은 Windsurf의 CEO 및 핵심 개발자들을 총 24억 달러에 인수하고 해리포터의 마법사가 되어버린 것 같습니다. 이는 OpenAI의 30억 달러 투자 제안을 물거품으로 만들어 놓았으며, 기술 경쟁에서 큰 타격을 입혔습니다. 이와 같은 사례는 최근 IT 업계에서 빈번하게 발생하고 있으며, 기업들이 인재를 확보하기 위해 자원을 쏟아 붓고 있다는 사실을 보여줍니다.\\n\\n### 인재 확보 전쟁: Google의 전략\\n\\nGoogle은 Windsurf의 핵심 인력을 \\'acqui-hire\\' 방식으로 확보하며, 규제를 피해갈 수 있는 전략을 극대화했습니다. 이러한 전략은 금전적으로도 합법적이긴 하지만, OpenAI와 같은 중소기업에게는 치명적인 결과를 초래할 수 있습니다. Windsurf의 CEO가 Google로 이직하자, 업계 전반에 파장이 일어났습니다. 여러 전문가들은 이러한 인재 이동이 기업 간의 경쟁 구조를 어떻게 변화시킬지에 대한 우려를 표명했습니다.\\n\\n![인재 확보 전쟁의 상징적 이미지](https://gagadget.com/media/post_big/ChatGPT_Image.png) (출처: Gagadget)\\n\\n### OpenAI의 위기와 반응\\n\\nOpenAI는 Google의 인재 확보 외에도 Meta로부터의 인재 유출 위협도 받고 있습니다. OpenAI의 CEO인 샘 올트먼은 이러한 상황에 대해 \"용병들의 침략\"이라고 표현하며 팀을 유지하기 위한 보상 인상을 시사했습니다. 그러나 Google과 Meta와 같은 대기업들이 가진 자본력과 인프라를 고려할 때, 중소 AI 스타트업의 입지는 더욱 좁아질 수밖에 없는 상황입니다.\\n\\n### 향후 전망과 전략\\n\\n이러한 경쟁 상황은 OpenAI가 더욱 적극적으로 기술 보호 및 인재 유지를 위한 전략을 수립해야 함을 의미합니다. 특히, 인재를 잃지 않기 위한 보상 및 근무 환경 개선이 필요하며, 슬프게도 이러한 상황에서는 정당한 투자나 인수도 위협이 됩니다. OpenAI는 이를 통해 시장 내 위치를 강화하고, 장기적으로 경쟁력을 유지해야 할 것입니다. \\n\\n결론적으로, 이 모든 변화는 AI 기술의 발전과 기업 간의 경쟁에서 중소 스타트업들에게 심각한 도전으로 작용할 것입니다. OpenAI가 어떻게 대응하느냐에 따라 AI 생태계의 향후 모습이 크게 달라질 수 있습니다. 이러한 역학 관계는 앞으로 더욱 심화될 것으로 예상됩니다.\\n\\n## ChatGPT의 개인화 기능 발전이 사용자 경험에 미치는 영향\\n### ChatGPT의 개인화 기능 발전이 사용자 경험에 미치는 영향\\n\\n최근 ChatGPT는 사용자와의 상호작용에서 개인화 및 기억 기능을 강화했습니다. OpenAI의 최신 업데이트에 따르면, 사용자와의 대화에서 중요한 세부사항을 기억하고 활용할 수 있는 **장기 기억 기능**이 추가되었습니다. 이러한 기능은 ChatGPT가 단기적인 정보뿐만 아니라, 과거의 대화 내용을 바탕으로 더욱 개인화된 답변을 제공할 수 있게 합니다. 예를 들어, 사용자가 “기억해줘... 내가 채식주의자야”라는 간단한 요청을 통해 자신의 특성을 저장하고 향후 대화에서 이를 반영하도록 할 수 있습니다.\\n\\n이러한 개인화 기능의 발전은 특히 지속적인 프로젝트나 필요에 따른 피드백 시, AI가 보다 유용한 **개인 비서**로서의 역할을 강화하는 데 기여합니다. 예를 들어 사용자가 피트니스 루틴을 시작한 경우, AI는 그 사용자의 활동 레벨과 식이 요법을 기억하여 보다 적절한 조언이나 추천을 제공할 수 있습니다. 이로 인해 사용자 경험이 더욱 원활하고, 개인화된 맞춤형 서비스로 진화하고 있습니다.\\n\\n기억 기능은 단순히 정보를 저장하는 것에 그치지 않고, 사용자가 자신이 저장하기 원하는 정보를 직접 선택하여 관리할 수 있도록 해 줍니다. 즉, 사용자는 저장된 내용을 언제든지 보거나 수정하고 삭제할 수 있는 권한을 가지기 때문에 **프라이버시**를 보장받을 수 있습니다. \\n\\n이미지 참고: 사용자 개인화 기능의 중요성을 강조하는 이미지가 함께 제공된다면, 본 기능의 실용성을 더욱 잘 보여줄 수 있습니다. 사용자 경험이 향상됨에 따라 ChatGPT가 제공하는 서비스의 질 또한 높아질 것입니다. 이는 AI 기술의 발전이 사용자와의 관계에서 어떻게 유의미한 변화를 가져오는지를 잘 보여줍니다.\\n\\n이러한 흐름은 기술 발전과 사용자 요구가 얼마나 긴밀하게 연결되어 있는지를 잘 나타내며, 앞으로도 개인화된 AI 서비스의 중요성은 더욱 커질 것입니다. ChatGPT의 장기 기억 기능이 어떻게 진화하고 사용되는지를 지켜보는 것은 기술과 인간의 상호작용이 어떻게 변화하는지를 이해하는 데 중요한 요소가 될 것입니다.\\n\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='10894073-0dc4-405e-873e-30cbb50ad797')]}\n",

OpenAI의 최신 업데이트에 따르면, 사용자와의 대화에서 중요한 세부사항을 기억하고 활용할 수 있는 **장기 기억 기능**이 추가되었습니다. 이러한 기능은 ChatGPT가 단기적인 정보를 넘어, 과거의 대화 내용을 바탕으로 더욱 개인화된 답변을 제공할 수 있게 합니다. 예를 들어 사용자가 “기억해줘... 내가 채식주의자야”라는 간단한 요청을 통해 자신의 특성을 저장하고 향후 대화에서 이를 반영하도록 할 수 있습니다.\\n\\n이러한 개인화 기능의 발전은 특히 지속적인 프로젝트나 필요에 따른 피드백 시 AI가 보다 유용한 **개인 비서**로서의 역할을 강화하는 데 기여합니다. 예를 들어, 사용자가 피트니스 루틴을 시작한 경우, AI는 그 사용자의 활동 레벨과 식이 요법을 기억하여 좀 더 적절한 조언이나 추천을 제공할 수 있습니다. 이로 인해 사용자 경험이 더욱 원활하고 개인화된 맞춤형 서비스로 진화하고 있습니다.\\n\\n기억 기능은 단순히 정보를 저장하는 것을 넘어 사용자가 자신의 정보를 직접 선택하여 관리할 수 있도록 해줍니다. 즉, 사용자는 저장된 내용을 언제든지 검토, 수정 또는 삭제할 수 있는 권한을 가지므로 **프라이버시**를 보장받을 수 있습니다. \\n\\n이미지 참고: 사용자 개인화 기능의 중요성을 강조하는 이미지가 함께 제공된다면 본 기능의 실용성을 더욱 잘 보여줄 수 있을 것입니다. 사용자 경험이 향상됨에 따라 ChatGPT가 제공하는 서비스의 질 또한 높아질 것입니다. 이는 AI 기술 발전이 사용자와의 관계에서 어떻게 유의미한 변화를 가져오는지를 잘 보여줍니다.\\n\\n이러한 흐름은 기술 발전과 사용자 요구가 얼마나 긴밀하게 연결되어 있는지를 잘 나타내며, 앞으로도 개인화된 AI 서비스의 중요성은 더욱 커질 것입니다. ChatGPT의 장기 기억 기능이 어떻게 진화하고 사용되는지를 지켜보는 것은 기술과 인간의 상호작용 변화에 대한 이해에 중요한 요소가 될 것입니다.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='3afefdb6-cbd7-4614-a994-55d2acabeb1a')]}\n",
